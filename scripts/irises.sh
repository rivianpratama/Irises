#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Irises — the front door: install, update, uninstall and detach, from one menu.
#
#   bash ./scripts/irises.sh        # or: npm run setup
#
# IT IMPLEMENTS NOTHING. Every action here ends in a call to scripts/engine-setup.sh,
# scripts/configure.sh or scripts/update.sh with flags, and the exact command line is PRINTED before
# it runs — so a run that went well can be repeated from a script, and a run that did not can be
# reported in one line. The flags stay the supported path for deploys and for agents; this file is
# for the human at the keyboard, who should not have to know them to be in control of what happens
# to their engine.
#
# WHAT IT ADDS over the flags: the questions. Which engine, which chats Irises fronts, which model
# her own voice runs on, what may be written to the engine's .env, what to change AFTERWARDS without
# re-installing, and — on the way out — whether to stop, detach, uninstall or delete. Everything it
# learns becomes flags, which is why the composed command line is printed rather than described.
#
# THE PROMPTS READ STDIN, and stdin only (see the helper block in lib/irises-lib.sh). This script
# never sets IRISES_ASSUME_YES, so a piped heredoc walks the same menu a person does; EOF at a menu
# is an answer too — it quits with exit 2 and points at the flag scripts, because a wizard that
# silently took every default for a terminal that went away is how an install nobody asked for
# happens. A CHILD INHERITS THAT STDIN: under a pipe it sees no TTY and auto-yeses from its own
# no-TTY block, which is what lets a heredoc walk install and configure the whole way through.
#
# THE DOUBLE-PROMPT RULE. The wizard confirms once. Update, uninstall, detach and stop pass --yes to
# the child, whose own y/N would be the same question twice. Two actions do NOT. Install: the
# engine-.env consent preview has to run inside engine-setup.sh, where the diff is computed, so the
# install child is invoked with --engine-env ask instead. Configure: scripts/configure.sh computes
# the +/~/- diff of what a setting would change and asks its own Apply? over it — a question this
# script cannot ask, because it does not know the old values or how the child would read them. So
# NO configure action passes --yes. The one gate this script keeps for itself is the "type the word
# delete" one in front of a purge, and the sha gate in front of a rollback.
#
# EXIT CODES
#   0  the menu was quit (each action reports its own child's exit code on screen)
#   2  stdin ran out with a question still open — nothing was changed
