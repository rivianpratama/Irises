#
# WHAT IT TOUCHES, in order: this clone's .env (chmod 600) · node_modules + dist · optionally
# web/out · a systemd --user unit, a LaunchAgent, or a Task Scheduler task on Windows · the engine's
# .env (backed up first, every added key recorded in $IRISES_HOME/install-manifest.json) · the
# engine's plugin dir · the engine's gateway, which is ALWAYS bounced at the end because the plugin,
# IRISES_FRONT and API_SERVER_* are only read when it starts.
#
# EXIT CODES
#   0  installed (or uninstalled) and verified
#   1  a step failed — read the message; nothing is left half-started that we can tell you about
#   2  wrong usage (unknown flag, unknown engine, bad port)
#   4  Irises did not report the expected build on /health within the budget
#   5  Irises is fine, but its engine's gateway could not be verified back up
# The last line of stdout is `RESULT: <token>` for every run that gets past argument parsing
# (`--help` and usage errors print none) — that is the line for scripts that wrap this one.
#
# Idempotent: re-run it any time. It adopts a server it finds already running and touches no engine
# source code. In the engine's .env it ADOPTS the secrets it finds — API_SERVER_KEY, IRISES_PUSH_TOKEN
# and IRISES_BRIDGE_TOKEN are read back out and reused, never replaced, because both sides read the
# same secret from two files. A key that is PRESENT BUT EMPTY is not a secret to adopt: this install's
# value goes in (said out loud, by name), and --uninstall puts the empty line back. The two keys it
# does take over regardless are the ones that have to name THIS
# install — IRISES_URL and API_SERVER_ENABLED — and it says so, loudly, when it changes either.
# Every key it found in place is recorded in the manifest, and keys this install changed (recorded as
# keysRetargeted) are restored from the pre-install backup on uninstall; keys it adopted or never
# touched are left as you have them — a secret you rotated after the install stays rotated.
