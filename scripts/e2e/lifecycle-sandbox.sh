# Irises lifecycle end-to-end — install, update, repair, roll back, recover, uninstall, in a sandbox.
#
#   npm run e2e:lifecycle          # or: bash scripts/e2e/lifecycle-sandbox.sh
#   KEEP=1 npm run e2e:lifecycle   # leave the sandbox behind for inspection
#
# NOT part of `npm test`: it starts real servers, binds real ports and takes 3-4 minutes (two stages
# deliberately sit out a wait budget in full). It is the battery that would have caught every bug the unit
# tests cannot see — the ones that only exist when the lifecycle stages run in sequence against each
# other: a rollback that leaves the box with no server, a repair that never repairs, a plugin
# refreshed for code that was then undone, a second uninstall that bounces an engine for nothing.
#
# OFFLINE BY CONSTRUCTION. The scratch PATH carries a stub `npm`:
#   ci    -> hard-link-copies THIS repo's node_modules into the sandbox clone
#   build -> runs the real node_modules/.bin/tsc + cpx + scripts/stamp-version.js
#   web   -> a logged no-op
# So there is no registry traffic, and the build is still a real compile: the two failure stages
# below publish commits that genuinely do not compile, and genuinely compile and then die at module
# load — the cases no unit test can stage.
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS, in order:
#   1   install    — detached start, /health serving the sha that was built, plugin copied to the
#                    stub engine, engine .env carrying our keys, manifest written, engine CLI called.
#                    The engine's .env is PRE-SEEDED with keys of its own, so this is also where the
#                    push token has to be adopted rather than replaced and IRISES_URL taken over out loud
#   1b  install×2   — a re-run adopts the running server, appends no key twice, the manifest still
#                    names OUR keys as ours instead of forgetting them to "pre-existing", and the
#                    restore point stays the FIRST install's backup
#   2   update      — a commit published to the fake origin is applied, the LIVE sha flips to it, the
#                    receipt is written, the plugin is refreshed, the engine CLI is called, and the
#                    whole run is readable afterwards in $IRISES_HOME/logs/update.log
#   2b  repair      — dist/version.json stamped from a sha nobody has: HEAD is current, so this is
#                    not an update but an unfinished build, and it is rebuilt and re-verified
#   3a  exit 3      — a commit that does not compile: the tree, dist and node_modules all go back,
#                    and the running server is never touched (same pid, same sha, still answering)
#   3   exit 4      — a commit that COMPILES and throws at module load: rolled back, the OLD build is
#                    serving again, and the engine's plugin was NOT refreshed for code that is gone
#   3b  recovery    — the box moves forward again after a rollback, and NOW the plugin is refreshed
#   3c  exit 5      — Irises is updated and live, but the engine's gateway cannot be verified back
#                    up: the update is not undone, and the run says so with its own exit code
#   4   uninstall   — the server stops, the plugin dir is gone, our keys are stripped from the engine
#                    .env, the pre-existing keys this install CHANGED come back to their pre-install
#                    values while an operator edit made after the install survives untouched, the
#                    stale manifest goes, and $IRISES_HOME is KEPT. The engine's .env is compared with
#                    cmp against the file from before stage 1, with that one operator edit applied:
#                    byte-identical, or this stage fails. It runs after TWO installs, so this is also
#                    where 1b's manifest memory is proved
#   5   uninstall×2 — a second one in a row changes nothing: no fresh backup, no gateway bounce, and
#                    — with the manifest now gone — no key deleted just because it is named IRISES_*
#   6   held port   — a foreign listener on our port (`npm run dev`, in real life) is refused in
#                    PREFLIGHT: exit 1, nothing merged, nothing built, no receipt, and the other
#                    process still holding the port it started with
#   7   full wiring — an install onto an engine that ALREADY carries every key Irises writes: it adds
#                    none, so its keysAdded is empty — and the uninstall still has to put the one key
#                    it RETARGETED back, which is the check the restore loop used to sit behind. The
#                    seed also holds a present-but-EMPTY IRISES_BRIDGE_TOKEN, which is not a secret to
#                    adopt: the install writes its own value there and records the move, and the cmp
#                    at the end proves the empty line came back
#   8   the menu    — scripts/irises.sh driven by answers on stdin: the flags it composes are printed
#                    and compared literally, and the install they produce is the one the answers
#                    described — a model override on all three voice roles with ENGINE_MODEL_INHERIT
#                    off, the key passed only through the environment, a narrowed IRISES_FRONT and
#                    the two optional extras. Then the same menu DETACHES (engine .env back to
#                    cmp-equal, plugin gone, Irises still serving) and finally uninstalls with an
#                    archive and a purge, the "type the word delete" gate answered at the menu
#                    rather than by a flag
#   8a  configure   — the same menu changing what 8 chose, one setting at a time and without an
#                    `npm ci` anywhere: a timezone, the browser chat, the front scope, the model
#                    handed back to the engine, one generic key, and last a PORT MOVE. Each answer
#                    has to come out as the right flag, land in the right file (this clone's .env,
#                    the engine's, the manifest) and cost exactly the restart it is worth — Irises
#                    is cycled and re-verified on the same build for a change she reads at boot,
#                    left alone for one only the engine reads, and the gateway is bounced for the
#                    engine's two. The key from stage 8 never reaches the screen again
#
# NOTHING OF YOURS IS TOUCHED. Every stage runs under a throwaway HOME, IRISES_HOME and HERMES_HOME,
# on two ephemeral ports, against a bare origin made from this clone's own objects. The scratch PATH
# is $BIN first, and the three service-manager probes on it are FAILING STUBS rather than absences:
# the library's augment_path re-appends /bin and /usr/bin on every run, so a tool cannot be kept off
# PATH by leaving it out of $BIN — and with the real ones visible, this box's own running engine
# gateway answers the library's service probe and stage 3c can never see its 90s budget expire.
# Stubs that log and exit 1 are how the sandbox stays blind to the machine it runs on.

# ── 8. the menu ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The front door, driven the only way a test can drive a wizard: answers on stdin. It is here at the
# end because it needs a clean engine and a clean $IRISES_HOME, and because it is the one stage that
# exercises the THREE scripts together — irises.sh composing flags, engine-setup.sh applying them.
#
# WHAT THIS STAGE IS FOR: the translation. Every answer typed below has to come out as the right
# flag on the command line irises.sh echoes, and that line has to produce the install it describes.
# The wizard drifting from the flags is the failure mode this whole file exists to catch — the menu
# can only be wrong in a way nobody notices if nothing compares the two.
#
# WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT EXERCISE: the install child's own engine-.env consent prompt. The
# wizard passes --engine-env ask and does NOT pass --yes, exactly as it does for a person; but the
# child inherits this pipe for stdin, sees no terminal, and takes its documented no-TTY path
# (ASSUME_YES=1), so it answers its own question with the default and writes. That is the same
# behaviour every agent-driven and piped install already has, and the assertions below are on the
# OUTCOME — the keys landed, and they are the ones the answers asked for.
#
# The port answered is the sandbox's own, because a wizard that could be talked into binding 3100 on
# the machine running the battery is not a sandbox any more. The ANSWER is still typed rather than
# defaulted, so the --port on the echoed line is the one that came out of the prompt.

# configured when its line is in a file. .env is parsed once at boot, so a change Irises reads costs
# a restart and a re-verified /health; the engine reads IRISES_FRONT and IRISES_URL only when its
# gateway starts, so those cost a bounce — and cost Irises NOTHING, which is the half that is easy
# to get wrong in the direction nobody notices. Each action below therefore checks three things:
# the flag the answer composed, the value where it actually lives, and who was made to restart.
#
# The port move is LAST and it is load-bearing for the rest of the file: it reassigns $SRV_PORT, so
