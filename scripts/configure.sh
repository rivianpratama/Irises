# ENVIRONMENT. Secrets travel this way and never on argv: a command line is readable by every other

#   IRISES_MODEL_API_KEY       the API key for --model-lane. Without one it is ignored, with a
#                              warning — the same thing the installer does
#   IRISES_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD  the /dashboard admin password (DASHBOARD_PASSWORD). Its presence is
#                              itself the request: it needs no flag
#   IRISES_SET_VALUE           the value for a bare `--set KEY`
#
# THE GENERIC EDITOR (--set / --unset)
#   • a KEY is A-Z, 0-9 and _, starting with a letter
#   • a key whose name ends in _KEY, _TOKEN, _PASSWORD or _SECRET may not carry its value on argv:
#     pass the name alone and put the value in IRISES_SET_VALUE
#   • PORT, IRISES_FRONT, OPS_BACKEND, HERMES_API_KEY, OPENCLAW_TOKEN, ENGINE_PUSH_TOKEN and
#     IRISES_HOME are refused. Each is written in more places than this clone's .env — the engine's
#     .env, the install manifest, the service unit — and a flag or a re-install is what moves them
#     all together
#   • a --set key has to be one .env.example or deploy/app.env documents, so a typo cannot go in
#     silently and sit there doing nothing until someone reads the file. Some real keys are only
#     described in PROSE in those files and so do not match: CONVO_MODEL_OPENAI /
#     CLASSIFY_MODEL_OPENAI / FALLFIRM_MODEL_OPENAI, and ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL. Use --allow-unknown
#   • DATA_BACKEND and EMBEDDINGS_DIMENSIONS change WHAT is stored and WHERE; they are warned about
#     and then applied, and nothing already written is migrated
#
# STDIN: run from the menu, this script's stdin IS the menu's stdin. So under --yes (and with no
# TTY, which this treats as the same thing) nothing here reads a line, and anything it shells out to
# gets </dev/null. Eat one line and the menu loses its next answer.
#
# EXIT CODES
#   0   applied, nothing needed changing, or --show
#   1   a step failed or was refused
#   2   wrong usage (an unknown flag, a value that cannot be right, or nothing to configure)
#   4   Irises restarted but /health did not report the build this clone is on
#   5   Irises is configured and live, but its engine's gateway could not be verified back up
#   130/143  stopped mid-run by a signal (Ctrl+C / SIGTERM); RESULT: partial, read the messages

# `partial` is a run that stopped before finishing — read the messages above to see how far it got.
