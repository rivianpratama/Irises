"""irises-bridge — front hermes channels with Irises. Zero hermes source changes.

Install (both steps are hermes's own official mechanisms):
    cp -r bridge/hermes/irises-bridge ~/.hermes/plugins/
    hermes plugins enable irises-bridge   # = config.yaml  plugins: { enabled: [irises-bridge] }
Environment (set for the gateway process):
    IRISES_URL           where Irises runs           (default http://127.0.0.1:3000)
    IRISES_BRIDGE_TOKEN  shared secret = Irises's ENGINE_PUSH_TOKEN
    IRISES_FRONT         comma-separated fnmatch patterns over "<platform>:<chat_id>"
                         e.g. "telegram:*"  or  "whatsapp:+1555*,discord:123".
                         EMPTY = front nothing (default — hermes behaves normally).
    IRISES_BRIDGE_PORT   loopback listener for Irises's outbound sends (default 8655)
    IRISES_BRIDGE_FAIL   open (default: on bridge error hermes answers itself) | closed
    IRISES_BRIDGE_WORKERS  forward worker threads / queue shards (default 2). Each chat is
                         pinned to one shard, so a chat's messages stay in order.

How it works (verified against hermes source):
  * `pre_gateway_dispatch` fires for every non-internal inbound message on EVERY platform,
    before auth/sessions/agent (gateway/run.py). Returning {"action": "skip"} suppresses
    hermes's own reply entirely. The hook is called SYNCHRONOUSLY on the gateway event loop,
    so this handler only pattern-matches + enqueues — all I/O happens on worker threads.
  * Outbound: a loopback HTTP listener accepts {"platform","chat_id","text"} from Irises and
    delivers via gateway.adapters[Platform].send(...) — the same in-process call hermes's own
    webhook adapter uses, uniform across every current and future platform.

Testability rule for this file: every DECISION lives in a pure function (the `_`-prefixed
helpers below, covered by bridge/hermes/test_irises_bridge.py). The threads and the HTTP
handler are thin shells that call them.
