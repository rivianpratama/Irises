# Irises — Setup & Deployment Runbook

> Secrets live in `.env`, which is gitignored — never commit it. If a key ever
> lands in a remote, rotate it in the provider console immediately.

## 1. Prerequisites
- **Node 22.13+** and npm (the local store uses the builtin `node:sqlite`).
- **Anthropic** API key, **OpenRouter** API key (fallback + voice transcription).
- A public HTTPS host for production (any small VM running Docker — §5 handles this with Caddy).
- Optionally, an **engine** (OpenClaw or hermes-agent) for email/reminders/deep work — see
  `docs/ENGINES.md`. Email, OAuth, and push webhooks live on the engine side, not in this app.

---

## 2. Run locally

### 2a. Fastest path (no infra at all)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rivianpratama/Irises.git
cd Irises
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit `.env` and set at minimum:
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-... # for voice + fallback
```
State persists to `~/.irises` out of the box (override with `IRISES_HOME`); add
`DATA_BACKEND=memory` if you want a throwaway run that leaves nothing behind.
Run it:
```bash
npm run dev          # tsx watch (hot reload)
# in another shell:
curl http://localhost:3000/health      # -> {"status":"ok",...}
```
Diagnostics dashboard: open `http://localhost:3000/debug` (localhost is allowed without a token).

### 2b. Connect an engine locally (optional)
Email, reminders, and deep work run on an external engine (OpenClaw or hermes-agent), not in
this app — set `OPS_BACKEND` + the engine keys in `.env` and follow `docs/ENGINES.md`. Without
an engine, the web chat still works; Irises just can't do engine-backed research or reminders.

`npm run build` compiles to `dist/` and copies the agent `Context.md` files; `npm start` runs the built server. Build it once to confirm everything compiles:
```bash
npm run build && npm start
```

---

## 3. Local storage

There is no database to provision. All state lives under **`IRISES_HOME`** (default
`~/.irises`; `/data` inside the Docker image), in the same style as the engines it fronts:

```
$IRISES_HOME/
├── irises.db                # SQLite (node:sqlite): conversations, profiles, prefs,
│                            # short-term memory, reply threading, token ledger,
│                            # error log, diagnostics
└── memories/<handle>/       # per-user curated memory, human-readable markdown
    ├── LONG.md + revisions/ # the long-term doc, every version snapshotted
    ├── MEDIUM.md            # active directives/notes/facts (+ MEDIUM.archive.md lineage)
    └── DOSSIER.md           # the LLM-merged dossier prose
```

- Schema is created automatically on first boot; retention sweeps (hourly/daily/6h) keep
  the store bounded on a small VM.
- **Backing up Irises = backing up this directory** (the `irises_state` volume in compose).
  The database runs in WAL mode, so copy it **quiesced**: `docker compose stop app`, copy the
  volume (all of it — `irises.db` plus any `-wal`/`-shm` siblings), `docker compose start app`.
  For a hot backup use `sqlite3 irises.db ".backup backup.db"` instead of a raw file copy.
- `DATA_BACKEND=memory` runs the same code against an ephemeral root — nothing persists
  (used by the test suite and throwaway runs).
- The daily token caps (`OPS_DAILY_TOKEN_CAP` / `LLM_DAILY_TOKEN_CAP` in `deploy/app.env`)
  enforce out of the box now that the ledger is always present.

## 4. Other keys
```
TRANSCRIBE_MODEL=google/gemini-2.5-flash
# per-agent model config lives in deploy/app.env: <AGENT>_PROVIDER (anthropic|openrouter) +
# <AGENT>_MODEL (Anthropic slug) + <AGENT>_MODEL_OPENROUTER (OpenRouter slug) for CONVO /
# CLASSIFY / FALLFIRM. Deep research has no model here — it runs on your engine's model.
# PDF engine: OPENROUTER_PDF_ENGINE.
```

---

## 5. Deploy to a VM

Any small VM running Docker works (1 GB RAM is enough with the compose memory limits). The
stack is two containers via `docker compose`: the app and **Caddy**, which terminates HTTPS
(automatic Let's Encrypt) for a `<VM_IP>.nip.io` host or a real domain and reverse-proxies
to `app:8080`. All secrets live in a single **`/opt/irises/.env`** (chmod 600) read by
Docker Compose; the committed non-secret baseline is `deploy/app.env`.

1. Build and ship the image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t irises:latest .
   # push to any registry the VM can pull from (ghcr.io/<you>/irises:latest, Docker Hub, …),
   # or skip the registry entirely: docker save irises:latest | gzip > irises.tar.gz, scp it
   # to the VM, and docker load < irises.tar.gz there.
   ```
2. On the VM, create `/opt/irises/` and copy in `deploy/docker-compose.yml`,
   `deploy/Caddyfile`, and `deploy/app.env`.
3. Create `/opt/irises/.env` from `deploy/env.vm.example`: set `IMAGE` to your image ref,
   `SITE_ADDRESS` to `<VM_IP>.nip.io` or your domain, and fill in the API keys.
   `chmod 600 /opt/irises/.env`. Open ports 80/443 in the host firewall.
4. Start it:
   ```bash
   cd /opt/irises && docker compose up -d --wait
   ```
5. Optional — a systemd unit so the stack returns after a reboot:
   ```ini
   # /etc/systemd/system/irises.service
   [Unit]
   Description=Irises (docker compose)
   Requires=docker.service
   After=docker.service network-online.target
   [Service]
   Type=oneshot
   RemainAfterExit=yes
   WorkingDirectory=/opt/irises
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker compose up -d
   ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker compose down
   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```
   Then `systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl enable irises`.

To ship an update: rebuild + push the image, then `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d --wait` on the VM.

### Updating a git-clone install

Installs made with `git clone` + `scripts/engine-setup.sh` (rather than the Docker image) update in
place, from a terminal on the box, in the Irises folder — Git Bash or a WSL2 shell on Windows:

```bash
bash scripts/update.sh        # add --check to preview, --yes to skip the prompt
```

The script fast-forward `git pull`s the current branch, runs `npm ci && npm run build` (and the web
client build when `web/out` exists — or `IRISES_WEB=1` asks for it — and the box has ~1.5 GB of
memory free; `IRISES_SKIP_WEB_BUILD=1` skips it outright, and a web build that fails warns instead of
failing the update), writes `$IRISES_HOME/update-receipt.json` — then, in this order, **restarts
Irises** (the user-level service, or the pidfile at `$IRISES_HOME/irises.pid`) **and verifies the new
build is what answers `/health`**, **refreshes the engine bridge plugin**, and **bounces the engine
gateway**. The plugin is refreshed on every run, and always after the restart is verified: a rollback
undoes this clone, not the engine's copy, so a refresh any earlier would leave the engine loading the
new plugin against the old code. Nothing is left for the operator to restart. There is no chat trigger
for any of this and none can be added: the script cycles the gateway, so an agent running it from a
gateway-hosted chat would kill its own supervisor mid-turn.

**Rollback.** If the new commit fails to compile, or compiles and then fails to answer `/health` with
the new build inside the boot window, the script returns the worktree to the commit that was running,
rebuilds THAT, and brings it back up. The failing tree is left in the log, not on the box.
`$IRISES_HOME` (your data) is never touched, a divergent local branch is never auto-merged (the script
stops and tells you to reconcile it), and a single-updater lock stops two runs racing on git and the
build.

**Exit codes** — worth reading if you script it. The last stdout line is always
`RESULT: ok|noop|up-to-date|update-available|rolled-back|gateway-failed`, or `RESULT: partial` for a
run that stopped before finishing (either nothing had been changed yet, or an undo failed and the
tree, `node_modules` and `dist` may be inconsistent — read the messages above it).

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | already up to date, or updated and healthy |
| `1` | preflight refused: dirty tree, detached HEAD, missing tool, Node below 22.13, no `.git`, another run holds the lock, or the pull could not fast-forward |
| `2` | bad arguments |
| `3` | the new build failed to compile — **rolled back**, the old build is running |
| `4` | the new build compiled but failed to boot — **rolled back**, the old build is running |
| `5` | Irises is on the new build, but the engine gateway would not restart — fix the gateway by hand |
| `10` | `--check` only: an update is available |

Flags: `--check`, `--yes`, `--no-restart` (pull and build only), `--no-gateway-restart` (leave the
gateway alone; the refreshed plugin loads on its next restart).

`scripts/engine-setup.sh` uses the same contract on its own side: `0` ok, `1` a step failed, `2` bad
arguments, `4` Irises never reported the expected build on `/health`, `5` the gateway could not be
verified back up — ending in `RESULT: ok|adopted|partial|health-failed|gateway-failed` for an install
and `RESULT: ok|partial|gateway-failed|noop` for an `--uninstall`. On both sides `partial` is the exit
guard's line: the run stopped before its summary (an unguarded error, or a Ctrl+C), so read the
messages above it rather than the token.

**After the gateway restart** hermes posts its own note into the user's home channel — *"♻️ Gateway
online — Hermes is back and ready."* That is hermes's message, not Irises's; she neither sends it nor
can suppress it. Silence it per platform with `<platform>.gateway_restart_notification: false` in
hermes's own config. Irises never edits hermes's config, so that is always the operator's own change.
The canonical account of it is [§ Gateway restart
notifications](ENGINES.md#gateway-restart-notifications).

The running server also checks the remote itself and reports what it finds:

- `GET /health` gains a `version` object (git `sha` / `branch` / build stamp) and an `update` object
  (`available`, `remoteSha`, `lastCheckAt`, `lastCheckOk`).
- The `/dashboard` overview shows a **version** card that turns amber when an update is available.
- In chat, Irises mentions a waiting upgrade once to recently-active chats, relays the
  `bash scripts/update.sh` line verbatim, and says a short "back on the new build" after the script
  restarts her. She also states her own build and whether one is waiting when asked — and says
  plainly that applying it is not something she can do.

Knobs (in `deploy/app.env` / `.env`): `UPDATE_CHECK_ENABLED` (default `true`),
`UPDATE_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS` (default 6h, floored at 15min), `UPDATE_CHECK_BRANCH` (defaults to the
clone's branch), `UPDATE_ANNOUNCE_ENABLED` (default `true` — `false` keeps detection but sends no
chat messages), `UPDATE_ANNOUNCE_ACTIVE_WINDOW_MS` (default 48h, the "recently active" window). A
Docker image built without `.git` reports `version.source: "unknown"`, disables the checker, and
makes Irises say she cannot tell whether an update is waiting.

**Service control.** The installer registers a user-level service, so none of this needs root:

```bash
systemctl --user status irises                     # Linux (systemd --user)
launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/ai.irises.server      # macOS (LaunchAgent)
schtasks /Query /TN Irises                         # Windows (Task Scheduler, cmd or PowerShell)
tail -f "${IRISES_HOME:-$HOME/.irises}/logs/server.log"
```

`schtasks /Run /TN Irises` and `schtasks /End /TN Irises` start and stop the Windows one. From Git
Bash, double the slashes — `schtasks //Query //TN Irises` — because MSYS rewrites a lone `/Query`
into a Windows path before `schtasks.exe` ever sees it. The task is
registered from an XML definition (restart-on-failure, no execution time limit) and its action is the
launcher `%USERPROFILE%\.irises\irises-start.cmd`, which is what appends to
`%USERPROFILE%\.irises\logs\server.log`. Under WSL2 the systemd path is used instead, and reboot
survival there needs systemd enabled in `/etc/wsl.conf` (`[boot] systemd=true`). **The Windows paths
are stub-tested only — no one has yet run them on a real Windows box**; Linux and macOS are the
verified platforms.

Where none of the three exists (a bare container, a shell with no user session bus) the installer
falls back to a detached `nohup` launch; stop that one with
`kill $(cat "${IRISES_HOME:-$HOME/.irises}/irises.pid")`.

**Uninstall.** `bash scripts/engine-setup.sh --uninstall` stops and unregisters the service, removes
the bridge plugin and the engine-side keys the installer added (read from
`$IRISES_HOME/install-manifest.json`, after backing the engine's env file up — with no manifest it
falls back to the Irises-marked `IRISES_*` keys and leaves `API_SERVER_*` alone), bounces the gateway
**only when it actually removed something** (a re-run on an already-clean box cycles nothing), and
keeps your data; `--purge-data` also deletes `$IRISES_HOME` after you type `delete` to
confirm (`--yes` skips the question), which is not reversible. The clone is never deleted; the script
prints the command. If the Photon reply-context patch series is applied to the hermes checkout, the
uninstall prints the revert instructions rather than touching it.

**Before you ship a change to any of this**, run the lifecycle battery: `npm run e2e:lifecycle`
exercises a real install → update → rollback → uninstall in a sandbox (throwaway `HOME`,
`IRISES_HOME` and engine home, ephemeral ports, an origin made from the clone's own objects) in about
three minutes. It is deliberately not part of `npm test`.

## 6. Verification checklist
- `curl https://your-domain.com/health` → 200.
- Open the web chat URL (served at `/`) or run `npm run chat` → Irises replies (paced bubbles).
- Ask "what does AS-IS mean" → answered inline (no delegation).
- Ask a question that needs research → instant ack, then a follow-up.
- `/debug?token=…` shows the prompts and the Convo→Ops delegation graph.
- With an engine connected: ask for a reminder a couple of minutes out → the engine's cron
  delivers it back through `POST /api/engine/push` and Irises pings you proactively.
- Logs: `sudo docker compose -f /opt/irises/docker-compose.yml logs -f app` shows the boot
  banner's endpoint list and `[channels] registered "web"` (plus `"bridge"` when an engine fronts chats).
