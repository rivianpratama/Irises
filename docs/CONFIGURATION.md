# Configuration reference

> This page was moved out of the README on 2026-09-19 and keeps the original, longer wording. hermes-agent is the tested engine. Every OpenClaw path described here is written but **untested** against a live gateway.

## Configuration

**On top of an engine you normally set none of this** — Irises auto-detects the backend, reuses the engine's key, and inherits its model (see [Models](#models)). Everything here is optional override. The supported way to change any of it on an installed box is the menu's **Configure** entry or `bash scripts/configure.sh` ([Changing settings after the install](INSTALL.md#changing-settings-after-the-install)), which previews the edit, backs the file up and restarts into it; editing `.env` by hand and restarting her yourself is still perfectly fine. Config is environment variables, layered lowest → highest: `deploy/app.env` (committed, non-secret baseline) loads first, then **engine auto-discovery** fills in / updates what it can from your engine, then your local `.env` layers on top and wins over both. The knobs you're most likely to touch:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` · `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` · `OPENAI_API_KEY` | The three LLM lanes (`OPENAI_BASE_URL` points the generic one) — auto-reused from the engine when present; set to override |
| `OPS_BACKEND` | `hermes` or `openclaw` — **auto-detected**; set to force one. Unset + no engine found = deep work offline (Convo still chats) |
| `HERMES_BASE_URL` · `HERMES_API_KEY` | hermes-agent's OpenAI-compatible API server + cron REST |
| `OPENCLAW_URL` · `OPENCLAW_TOKEN` | OpenClaw gateway WebSocket |
| `ENGINE_PUSH_TOKEN` | One secret guarding both engine-facing routes (push + bridge inbound) |
| `IRISES_HOME` · `DATA_BACKEND` | State dir (default `~/.irises`) · `memory` = ephemeral run |
| `IRISES_TZ` | Your wall clock (IANA zone) when the box lives somewhere you don't — a VPS in another region, a container on UTC. Default: the host's zone |
| `WEB_ENABLED` · `DEBUG_TOKEN` | Web debug chat (browser + `npm run chat` CLI) + its access gate |


### Full configuration reference



**Engine (the deep half)** — see [docs/ENGINES.md](ENGINES.md)

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `OPS_BACKEND` | `hermes` \| `openclaw`; **auto-detected at boot** from the installed engine — set to force one. Unset + none found = deep work offline, no local fallback. |
| `ENGINE_MODEL_INHERIT` | `off` to stop Irises's voice roles inheriting the engine's model and keep its own shipped models (default: on). |
| `HERMES_BASE_URL` · `HERMES_API_KEY` | hermes API server (default `http://127.0.0.1:8642`) and its `API_SERVER_KEY` (auto-derived from `~/.hermes/.env` when unset). |
| `OPENCLAW_URL` · `OPENCLAW_TOKEN` · `OPENCLAW_AGENT_ID` | Gateway WS (default `ws://127.0.0.1:18789`), auth token, agent (default `main`). |
| `HERMES_CAPABILITIES` · `OPENCLAW_CAPABILITIES` | Optional comma list from `web,inbox,files,code,media,scheduling` — what the operator declares the engine can do, so Irises never promises more. On hermes, live `/v1/toolsets` discovery overrides it; on OpenClaw it is the only source. Unset = unknown. |
| `ENGINE_ONBOARDING` | `off` disables the one-time engine-mode onboarding sent at boot (both engines). |
| `FIRST_MOVE_ENABLED` | `false` skips the one-time install introduction (engine memory pull + her first text). One-shot state lives in `$IRISES_HOME/first-move.json`, so restarts and updates never re-fire it. |
| `ENGINE_PUSH_TOKEN` | Shared secret for `POST /api/engine/push` (`x-engine-token`) **and** `POST /api/bridge/inbound` (`x-bridge-token`). Unset = loopback-only. |
| `ENGINE_TIMEOUT_MS` · `ENGINE_MAX_CONCURRENT` | Per-call budget (default `OPS_TASK_TIMEOUT_MS − 15s`) and the engine-call semaphore (default 2). |
| `HERMES_RUN_TRANSPORT` | `runs` (default) \| `chat` — which transport a hermes delegation speaks. `runs` = `POST /v1/runs` + SSE events, the one that lets stop and `steer_research` reach an in-flight leg; `chat` = the old blocking `/v1/chat/completions` body, no run control. Falls back to `chat` on its own for an image-bearing task or a hermes with no runs API. |
| `OPS_CANCEL_ENGINE_ABORT` | On give-up (user says stop, or Irises's own leg timeout) also tell the engine to stop working — hermes `POST /v1/runs/{id}/stop`, OpenClaw's abort RPC. `off` reverts to dropping the connection locally (the orphaned-run bug this exists to fix). Both engines. Default on. |
| `OPS_APPROVAL_GATE` | Park a delegation that would act in the world until the user says yes in that chat. `off` = kick it off immediately, no question, no parked row. Default on. |
| `HERMES_BRIDGE_URL` · `IRISES_PUSH_URL` | Where Irises sends bridge replies (default `http://127.0.0.1:8655`) and the push URL embedded in engine cron jobs. |

**Channels**

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `WEB_ENABLED` · `WEB_DEBUG_HANDLE` · `WEB_DEBUG_CHAT_ID` | Web channel toggle + its synthetic single-user identity (browser chat and the `npm run chat` CLI). |

**Data, access, and behavior**

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `IRISES_HOME` · `DATA_BACKEND` | Where the local store lives (SQLite + memory markdown); `memory` = ephemeral. |
| `IRISES_CYCLE_ANCHOR` | "Day 1" of the hidden 28-day affect cycle (ISO date, default `2026-01-01`). Never surfaced to the user; only sets the mood-baseline phase math. |
| `IRISES_TZ` | IANA zone for the user's wall clock: every clock the Convo model reads (the current time, transcript stamps, "your last one at", the daypart words), the overnight quiet hours (9pm–8am), and any reminder set without naming a zone. Default: the host's own zone, then UTC. A per-user `agent_tz` saved from chat still wins over it. |
| `DEBUG_TOKEN` | Gates `/debug` **and** the web chat endpoints (unset = localhost-only). |
| `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` | Gates `/dashboard`. **Has a built-in default — set your own before exposing the port.** |
| `PORT` · `NODE_ENV` | Listen port (3000 dev, 8080 in the image) and persona caching mode. |
| `<ROLE>_PROVIDER` · `<ROLE>_MODEL` · `<ROLE>_MODEL_OPENROUTER` · `<ROLE>_MAX_TOKENS` · `<ROLE>_EFFORT` · `<ROLE>_THINKING` | Per-role model routing and reasoning knobs (see below). |
| `OPS_TASK_TIMEOUT_MS` · `OPS_RETRY_ENABLED` · `OPS_PROGRESS_*` · `OPS_MAX_PROGRESS_PINGS` | Delegation deadline (4 min), the single cheap retry, and the "still on it" ping throttle. |
| `ROUTING_GATE` | `off` disables the grounding screen that forces data questions through the engine. |
| `CONVO_ROUTING_GATE_MEMORY_AWARE` | `off` makes that screen text-only again: it stops standing down for a data question she answered off something she already holds, and a delegation stops carrying what she holds to the engine (it rides beside the brief, in the task's own field, never inside it). Default on. |
| `CONVO_HOOKS_ENABLED` | The idle-turn machinery: the idle gate, the hook selector and kill switch, the per-turn hooks section and its craft page, and the quiet re-ask. `off` removes the machinery, not the character (that is a branch). Default on. |
| `LEAF_EXAMPLES_EXTRA` | Not a switch: extra comma-separated tokens for the idle gate's English fast path, read at call time. Adding one only ever widens the free path; the classify layer still catches what the examples miss. Empty by default. |
| `REFUSAL_FLOOR` | `off` disables the screen that catches a reply falsely claiming it can't reach something the engine can, and delegates instead. |
| `MEMORY_PROVENANCE_ENABLED` | Stamp every durable fact `stated` \| `seeded` \| `inferred` so a guess is never cited as testimony. **Default off** — the one default-off switch in the focus set, because it changes what a memory file contains (the read side parses stamps either way). |
| `BATCH_SETTLE_MS` · `TYPING_CPM` · `TYPING_DELAY_MAX_MS` · `TYPING_TRAILING_STOP_MS` | Batching + simulated-typing pacing, and the guarded trailing typing-stop that keeps a stateful indicator (Photon) from burning after a reply. |
| `LLM_DAILY_TOKEN_CAP` · `OPS_TASK_TOKEN_BUDGET` · `LLM_MAX_INPUT_TOKENS_EST` | Cost circuit breakers (tripping fails loud, never re-billed on the other lane). |
| `DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED` · `DIAGNOSTICS_*` | `/debug` trace buffer sizing and retention. |

**Updates** — see [docs/DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md#updating-a-git-clone-install)

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `UPDATE_CHECK_ENABLED` | The periodic `git ls-remote` poll that notices a newer build on this clone's branch. It reads refs only — never pulls, never restarts. `false` disarms it: no `update` field on `/health`, no amber dashboard card, no chat mention, and Irises then says plainly that she can't tell whether one is waiting. Default on. Disarms itself anyway with no `.git` (a Docker image) or an unknown build sha. |
| `UPDATE_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS` | How often to poll. Default 6h (`21600000`), floored at 15min; a non-numeric value falls back to the default. First check is 60s after boot. |
| `UPDATE_CHECK_BRANCH` | Which remote ref to compare against. Default: this clone's own current branch. |
| `UPDATE_ANNOUNCE_ENABLED` | Whether a waiting upgrade is mentioned **in chat** — once per chat per build, woven into a reply at a natural opening (30+ min of quiet, or their first message ever), otherwise pushed to recently-active chats — plus the short "back on the new build" after the script restarts her. `false` keeps detection, `/health` and the dashboard card, and sends nothing. Default on. |
| `UPDATE_ANNOUNCE_ACTIVE_WINDOW_MS` | The "recently active" audience window for that mention. Default 48h (`172800000`), capped at 20 chats. |
| `IRISES_SKIP_WEB_BUILD` · `IRISES_WEB` | Read by the scripts, not the server: `IRISES_SKIP_WEB_BUILD=1` skips the optional web-client rebuild during install and update; `IRISES_WEB=1` asks for it on a box that has never built it. |

**Memory features** — see [docs/MEMORY_ARCHITECTURES.md](MEMORY_ARCHITECTURES.md)

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `MEMORY_SEMANTIC_RECALL` | `on` adds the embedding leg to archive recall (background backfill on the OpenRouter key, never a per-turn call). **Off by default** — off means no client is even built. |
| `EMBEDDINGS_MODEL` · `EMBEDDINGS_DIMENSIONS` · `MEMORY_EMBED_*` · `MEMORY_VECTOR_CANDIDATES` · `MEMORY_SEMANTIC_MIN_SCORE` | Semantic-recall knobs: model, vector width (changing it re-embeds the archive), backfill pacing, scan ceiling, and the cosine floor a hit must clear. |
| `MEMORY_RECALL_EXPANSION` | Paraphrase tolerance for keyless installs — one tiny classify call widens a recall query with synonyms (appended *after* the user's own words). Ignored while embeddings are active. Default on. |
| `NOTE_GROOM_ENABLED` · `NOTE_GROOM_THROTTLE_MS` | Fold near-duplicate saved notes into one (throttled, locally re-validated; retired notes stay in the archive). Default on / 6h. |
| `RELATIONSHIP_CLIMATE_ENABLED` | The weeks-scale standing register (ease / candor / playfulness), one classify eval per 22h inside code-owned clamps. `false` stops both the eval and the read immediately; the stored row survives. Default on. |
| `CONVO_THREADING_ENABLED` | The theme + open-loop inventory. Zero extra LLM calls; `false` gates both the harvest and the pre-turn read, and the stored inventory survives being turned off. Default on. |
| `MEMORY_MOMENTS_ENABLED` | The nightly moments pass and the per-turn sampler. Off = no moments written or offered; the file survives. Default on. |
| `MEMORY_THESIS_ENABLED` | The weekly thesis rewrite and the per-turn thesis section. Off = no read written or rendered; the file survives. Default on. |
| `MEMORY_SELF_ENABLED` | The daily SELF.md pass (her own stances, tastes, lessons, changes of mind) and the per-turn self section. Off = nothing written or rendered; the file survives. Default on. |
| `IRISES_MUSINGS_ENABLED` | Lets her text first about something on her own mind, apart from anything the user set up. Bounds: one a day at most, daytime, only after recent contact and a quiet chat, never a room. Default on. |
| `THREADING_PINGS_ENABLED` | Lets her *start* a message about a loop left hanging. **Default off** (it buzzes a phone unprompted); hard bounds when on — one ping per person per week, 48h of silence first, never a group, never twice about the same thing. |
| `FIRST_MOVE_ENABLED` | The one-time install introduction described above. Default on. |

`.env.example` is the annotated local template; `deploy/app.env` carries the shared baseline.



## Models

**By default, Irises speaks on your engine's model.** Deep work already runs on the engine; on top of that, at boot Irises reads your hermes/OpenClaw's configured **model, provider, endpoint, and key** and points its own three voice roles at the *same model on the same API* — so the voice works whatever the engine runs on, including a non-OpenRouter, non-Anthropic ("obscure") OpenAI-compatible API (OpenAI, Azure, vLLM, deepseek-direct, Groq, a self-hosted gateway…). Every reachable lane gets the engine's own slug; nothing is swapped in for it, and the only reshaping is spelling an id the way its API takes it (the Anthropic Messages lane wants a bare `claude-…`, not `anthropic/claude-…`). So the big model you chose for deep work is also the one answering chat — its cost and its latency included. A foreign auth/protocol Irises can't call directly (Bedrock, Vertex, Gemini-native, OAuth) keeps a working fallback lane and warns. Nothing to configure. *(Auto endpoint/key inheritance is implemented for hermes; an OpenClaw user on an obscure API sets it by hand — see [docs/ENGINES.md](ENGINES.md#model-inheritance).)*

There are **three lanes**: `anthropic` (native SDK, honours `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`), `openrouter` (openrouter.ai + its proprietary extras), and `openai` (a generic OpenAI-compatible client whose endpoint is `OPENAI_BASE_URL`). Want a cheaper or faster voice, or a different endpoint? Override any role independently: `<ROLE>_MODEL` / `<ROLE>_MODEL_OPENROUTER` / `<ROLE>_MODEL_OPENAI` / `<ROLE>_PROVIDER`, plus `OPENAI_BASE_URL` / `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` — anything you set wins over what's inherited. To stop inheriting and keep Irises's own shipped models, set `ENGINE_MODEL_INHERIT=off`. The live model map (voice vs. deep-work) shows in `/health`, the `/dashboard` overview, and `npx tsx ./scripts/print-model-map.ts` — and Irises will tell you in chat if you ask.

With **no engine** (the debug/standalone path) Irises falls back to its own shipped models — three roles, OpenRouter-primary with an Anthropic fallback lane:

| Role | Standalone default | Anthropic fallback |
|------|-----------------|--------------------|
| **Convo** — front line (and the Composer re-voice) | `openai/gpt-5.6-luna:nitro` | `claude-sonnet-5` |
| **Classify** — routing, preference screens, failure triage | `openai/gpt-5.6-luna:nitro` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| **Fallfirm** — holding beats + recovery voice | `openai/gpt-5.6-luna:nitro` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| **Transcribe** — voice memos *(never inherited — needs an audio model)* | `google/gemini-3.5-flash-lite:nitro` | *(OpenRouter only)* |

`<ROLE>_PROVIDER` picks the primary lane per role (`anthropic` | `openrouter` | `openai`); the first configured other lane becomes the automatic fallback on 5xx / 429 / network errors.
