// The early-emit gate: the PURE decisions behind sending a bubble before the reply that carries it
// has finished generating. A later task (streaming the reply sentence-by-sentence, Task 15) is the
// impure half — it owns the model connection, the send timing and the fallback when the gate says
// no partway through. Everything here is a function of its arguments alone, on purpose: the ONE
// failure this whole feature must never cause is a sentence reaching the user that a downstream
// guard would have discarded or rewritten, and a gate that is pure is a gate a test can pin down to
// every combination without a model in the loop.
//
// Three questions, three functions:
//   • streamArmed  — before the call even starts, is this turn's shape one where an early sentence
//     is safe at ALL? (a whole-turn question, decided once)
//   • sentenceBlocker — for one sentence that already streamed out of the model, does it carry a
//     failure shape the send path would have caught downstream? (a per-sentence question, decided
//     once per candidate)
//   • cleanEarlySentence — the cosmetic cleanup sendBubbles already applies to every bubble
//     (routing-tag strip, echoed-timestamp strip, tool-name redaction, Ops-scaffolding strip).
//     Reused verbatim so an early-sent bubble and a normally-sent bubble are byte-identical for the
//     same input — two cleanup paths for one bubble is how they drift.
//
// REUSE, NOT REIMPLEMENTATION. Every check below calls the same function the non-streamed path
// already trusts (unkeptPromise.ts's two detectors, routingGate.ts's refusal map, guardrails.ts's
// two scrubs, replyThreading.ts's tag strip, chatTime.ts's marker strip). A second lexicon here would
// only ever be a second place for the first one to go stale against.
