// Temporal awareness for the user-facing voices. Two feeds come out of here:
//
//  1. timestampMarker() — a `[Mon, Jul 6, 9:14 PM]` (full date + clock, always) prefix rendered
//     onto every history turn at FORMAT time (storage untouched), so the model can see the thread's
//     rhythm: what sat for hours, what was a live volley, what went cold for days.
//  2. renderConversationTiming() — a precomputed "Conversation timing" prose block for the system
//     prompt / brief. LLMs are unreliable at date arithmetic, so the gap math, whose-wait-it-is,
//     and the regime call (live / same-day / overnight / multi-day) are decided in code and
//     expressed in words the persona can act on directly.
//
// The behavioral rules the personas pair with these live in each agent's Context.md ("time is
// real in this chat"): never measure the USER's reply latency, one light beat max for Irises's own
// lateness, loose human time-talk only. The markers themselves are metadata — never echoed into a
// bubble; stripTimestampMarker() in the send path is the code backstop for that rule.
