// The mouth — the one pipeline every out-of-band user-facing message speaks through, built on the
// per-chat send lock (sendQueue.ts). It exists to kill a whole class of race conditions: a message
// VOICED against the thread as it looked seconds ago, LANDING after the thread has moved on.
//
// The invariant it enforces, per chat: voice → send → record is ONE atomic critical section. A
// voicer (a thunk that reads conversation history and calls a model) runs only once it owns the
// mouth — at which point every previously-queued outbound has been fully sent AND recorded, and
// nothing else can send until this one finishes. So whatever a voicer reads is, by construction,
// exactly the thread the user will see its reply land on. No snapshot can go stale between voicing
// and sending, because nothing can move the thread in that window.
//
// For content that must be voiced EARLY (progress pings reserve their throttle slot before the slow
// voice call), the mouth instead offers staleness guards re-checked the moment the send owns the
// lock: `dropIf` (arbitrary sync predicate — "the answer already shipped", "the user cancelled")
// and `staleIfSpokenSince` (Irises said something in this chat after the text was voiced). A stale
// message is DROPPED, never sent — a late "still on it" after the answer is a contradiction, and
// silence is the correct fallback for a reassurance.
//
// `priority: 'critical'` (suspected fraud) bypasses the lock entirely — the one deliberate
// exception, where interleaving a live reply is better than delaying an emergency.
