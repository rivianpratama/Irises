// Inbound door for engine-fronted chats: the bridge plugins (bridge/hermes, bridge/openclaw —
// installed INTO the engines via their official plugin mechanisms) POST every fronted inbound
// message here, having suppressed the engine's own reply. From here it is a completely normal
// Irises turn: enqueueInbound → Convo → (deep work back on the engine) → Composer → the bridge
// channel delivers through the engine's connection.
//
// This file is only the DOOR: auth, one call into ./contract.ts, one claim against
// bridge_inbound_seen, the receipt, and the answer. What a v1 payload IS lives in the contract;
// mapBridgeMedia and normalizeTimestamp are re-exported from here because they were born here and
// callers (and bridge.test.ts, the byte-identity oracle for the coercions) import them from this
// path.
//
// Auth mirrors /api/engine/push: ENGINE_PUSH_TOKEN set → x-bridge-token must match exactly;
// unset → loopback-only (dev). One token guards both engine-facing doors on purpose — the setup
// script provisions it once into the engine's plugin environment.
