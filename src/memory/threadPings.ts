// The thread-revisit ping: the one place threading STARTS a message instead of colouring a reply.
//
// Everything else in this feature happens inside a turn the user began — the harvest folds what she
// noticed into the row, the pre-turn read puts at most one thing in front of her. This file has no
// turn to hang off. It sweeps the store on a timer, finds a loop that has been quiet for a few days
// with nobody having asked how it went, and texts a phone about it.
//
// That difference is the whole reason for the shape below:
//   • DEFAULT OFF (see threadingPingsEnabled). Every other memory flag in the engine defaults ON,
//     because every other memory flag only decides how something she was ALREADY going to say gets
//     coloured. This one decides whether a phone buzzes at someone who did not write to her. That is
//     the one surface an install has to opt INTO, not out of.
//   • BILL FIRST, THEN DELIVER. The weekly budget is spent before the send is attempted, so a
//     delivery that fails still costs the week. That is the cheap side of the trade: the expensive
//     side would be a failure that leaves the budget unspent, an hourly sweep that finds the same
//     loop still eligible, and a person getting the same question twice.
//   • ONE FAILING HANDLE ENDS ONE HANDLE. The sweep walks everybody; a bad row, a missing chat, a
//     dead voice lane for one person must not silence the ping the next person had coming.
//
// Gates, in order, all of them cheap and all of them code: both flags → not a room → not already
// pinged this week → the thread has actually gone quiet → an eligible loop exists → we know where to
// send it. Only then does anything get written or sent.
