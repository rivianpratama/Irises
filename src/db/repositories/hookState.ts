// The persisted rhythm ledger: the last few kinds of extra beat a CHAT's replies carried, the idle
// streak, and the spacing clock for moment offers.
//
// Keyed by chat_id, following affect_state rather than the memory tiers — and it is the right key
// here rather than the historical outlier it is there. What a person keeps circling back to belongs
// to the PERSON; how fast she has been talking belongs to the ROOM. Three sharp replies in a group
// are three sharp replies whoever typed at her, so the fourth turn goes quiet for everyone in it,
// and a room accumulates a ledger exactly like a one-to-one chat does. The `handle` column rides
// alongside the key so the dashboard and the per-handle sweep can find whose rows these are; it is
// never read back into the state.
//
// Read doctrine is threadInventory.ts's, which is relationshipClimate.ts's: reads DEGRADE, never
// throw. A missing row, a mangled blob, a hand-edited counter — each falls back to the safest thing
// that still lets the turn proceed, which is the DEFAULT state (the one that renders nothing and
// forbids nothing). This sits on the reply path: a read failing here must cost the rhythm and
// nothing else. The safe direction is unmistakable — degrading to defaults can only ever open a
// hook back up, never force a quiet turn onto someone who never earned one.
//
// Writes carry the /forget fence (getForgetEpoch, see memory.ts). The window it closes is the TURN,
// not the dispatch: the ledger row is read at the top of convo/client.ts, before the prompt is even
// built, and written inside processConvoResult before the ChatResponse is returned — the channel
// send happens after that, out in src/index.ts. So between the read and the write sit the model
// call, the tool loop and up to two corrective re-asks, which is many seconds during which a
// /forget can land, and a save that read the pre-forget state must not put back what the wipe
// removed. The write itself is awaited (see convo/shared.ts): the fence is what makes it safe, not
// the ordering against the send.
