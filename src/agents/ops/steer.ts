// Delivering a mid-run ADDITION to the engine: the user narrowed, corrected, or thought of one
// more thing while a lookup was already going, and dropping the run to start over would throw away
// minutes of real work.
//
// Why a retry ladder rather than one POST: hermes only accepts a steer while the run's status is
// exactly `running` (api_server.py `_handle_steer_run` — the status gate, not the mere presence of
// an agent ref). A freshly dispatched run spends a second or two `queued` and then constructing its
// agent, and a user who types "also check jakarta" one second after Irises said "on it" lands
// squarely inside that window. A 409 there is not a failure; it is "not yet".
//
// Everything here is best-effort by construction: it runs inside a live Convo turn, beside a leg
// that is doing the actual work. Nothing throws, and a steer nobody could deliver is not a lost
// instruction — it stays on the in-flight entry (state/opsCoordination.ts), so the status line reads
// it back and the follow-up leg folds it in.

 * its window into something the user hears about instead of silence.
