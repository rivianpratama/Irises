// The first move: the one-shot machine that turns a finished install into a first message.
//
// Irises has never spoken first. After `engine-setup.sh` completes she sits silent until the user
// texts her, which means her opening line lands with no idea who she is talking to — even though the
// engine she now fronts has lived with that person for months. This module closes that gap ONCE, in
// four durable phases:
//
//   pull  — ask the engine what it knows (firstMoveAsk.ts's words, firstMoveProfile.ts's doubt)
//   seed  — fold the answer into her own memory tiers (seedFromEngine.ts)
//   send  — text them first, but ONLY where the engine confirms real prior history on that chat
//   weave — otherwise: she introduces herself INSIDE her reply to their own first text
//
//   $IRISES_HOME/first-move.json
//   { hermes?: { askVersion, pulledAt, profile, seededAt, handle, mode, sentAt, outcome, … } }
//
// Keyed by ENGINE NAME, exactly like engine-onboarding.json next door, and read with the same
// lenient-load / best-effort-save discipline: a missing or mangled file reads as "never ran" (one
// duplicate introduction is the worst it can cost), and a failed write never takes a boot down.
//
// WHY THIS DEFAULTS ON, unlike THREADING_PINGS_ENABLED. That flag guards a recurring, unprompted
// question that arrives forever, on a schedule nobody asked for — an install that upgraded INTO it
// would find Irises texting its user out of the blue, so it must be opted into. This is exactly ONE
// message, minutes after an operator deliberately ran an installer, addressed to the one person that
// installer was run for. The install IS the consent, and a feature shipped dark here is the feature
// not existing. The off switch stays for the silent install (a deployment handed over before the
// person on the far end knows anything is coming).
//
// AND WHY IT STILL CANNOT COLD-TEXT. The proactive send fires only when the engine says, in so many
// words, that it has already exchanged messages in that exact chat (`has_history`, coerced to a
// strict boolean that defaults false). Every other reading — no channel, an unsure engine, a pull
// that never landed — arms the reactive weave instead, where the first word is still theirs. Nothing
// in this file can put a message in front of somebody who has never written to us.

 * The weave block for THIS turn, or null. Called from buildSystemPrompt's dyn-section assembly on
 * every 1:1 Convo turn, so the ordinary answer — after the one turn this ever fires on — is null
 * from a cached state read and nothing else.
 *
 * Three refusals worth naming:
 *   • a GROUP handle. Structural, like every other memory surface: the introduction is one person's
 *     first conversation, and a room is not a person.
 *   • a pull that has not RESOLVED (no profile yet). The turn is never blocked on an engine round
 *     trip — the persona's own Onboarding section already knows how to meet a stranger, and this
 *     block only adds what the seeded picture makes possible.
 *   • anything SETTLED. The proactive send already went, or a previous turn already wove it.
 *
 * The one write it performs is the RE-KEY. Until a real message arrives, the handle is the engine's
 * prediction (`eng:<platform>:<chat_id>`); the inbound router keys the sender on `sender_id ?? chat`,
 * which can differ. This is the exact moment the truth arrives, so the seed is re-run against the
 * handle that actually texted — and the seed's own guards (write-only-into-a-vacuum, upsert-by-key,
 * skip-a-lived-in-inventory) make that a near no-op rather than a second copy.
