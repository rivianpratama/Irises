// The doctrine half, both twins. The engine was always invited to run code, use its tools and

// invitation, and nothing said a setup it could not finish owes a report rather than a silence.
//
// The hard limits are the reason this file is paranoid: widening the invitation must move nothing
// about the user's accounts, the never-message-the-user rule, or the one line that lifts read-only.
