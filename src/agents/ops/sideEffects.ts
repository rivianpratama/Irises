// Does this delegation ACT in the world, or only read it?
//
// Every TaskKind Irises has ever had is read/compute/draft, and both engine doctrines say so in
// prose ("read-only on their inbox, never send or post anything anywhere"). A real assistant has to
// be able to send, book and buy once the user says yes — so the question "would the ENGINE change
// something outside Irises?" needs an answer before anything starts, and this module is that answer.
//
// TWO SOURCES, EITHER SUFFICIENT:
//   • the model's own `effect` tag on delegate_to_ops — it just read the message, in whatever
//     language the message was written in;
//   • the English phrase list below — the fast, free path that catches a mutating ask the model
//     forgot to tag.
//
// LANGUAGE-AGNOSTIC RULE (user, 2026-09-04): there are NO other-language word lists anywhere in the
// code. English is the fast path; every other language is covered by the model's tag, because the
// model reads every language and a hand-written lexicon per language never will. So a Spanish
// "envía un correo…" is invisible here by design, and reaches 'act' through the tag alone.
//
// PURE: the lexicon, the verdict, and the two strings the ask is voiced from. The park, the receipt
// and the one re-ask live in the delegate handler (convo/shared.ts), which is the only place with a
// model to re-ask and a database to park in.

/**
 * The side-effect lexicon — ENGLISH ONLY (see the rule above). Whole phrases, case-insensitive,
 * clause-bounded, matched with a negation and a quote guard.
 *
 * SINGLE SOURCE (the PROMISE_PHRASES / THEME_KINDS pattern): the trigger, the receipt's `trigger`
 * field and the tests all read this same array, so a phrase can never be one the gate fires on but
 * nothing else knows about.
 *
 * Deliberately generous rather than clever. A false positive costs exactly one extra question
 * ("before i do it — you want me to …?"); a false negative is the engine sending mail nobody
 * approved. The `trigger` on every receipt is what makes the false-positive rate readable, and the
 * list is meant to be tightened from that data, not from guesses.
