// The irreducible floor — the ONLY hardcoded user-facing copy left in the codebase.
//
// Fallfirm (client.ts) re-voices every failure and confirmation through the LLM so the user never
// sees dev copy. But Fallfirm is itself an LLM call, and "never go silent" is absolute — so when even
// Fallfirm's call throws or comes back empty (provider down, timeout), we still have to say SOMETHING.
// That backup-to-the-backup lives here: a tiny, generic, in-character line per outcome kind, all in
// one audited place. If you're adding a hardcoded user-facing string anywhere else, don't — route it
// through voiceOutcome() instead. Output is the legacy `\n---\n` bubble wire format the send path
// consumes; the per-bubble guardrails (redactInternalTools / stripOpsScaffolding) still run downstream.

// call (that latency would defeat the reassurance). Centralized here so no instant copy is scattered.
//
// Every line below is a small POOL, not a single string — one hardcoded phrase repeated verbatim
// across a conversation reads like a bot. The holding and still-on-it pools go further: they are
// handed her last few beats for the chat (state/holdingBeats.ts, oldest first) and `pickFresh`
// never picks one of those while a fresh line is left. It stays a synchronous, zero-latency lookup:
// the caller already holds that list, nothing is read here.
//
// The holding pools mirror the three beat shapes the prompts teach — a thinking sound, a short
// wait, a line naming the thing — so a fallback beat is as varied as one she writes herself. Each
// line promises only a look that is starting: none claims a result or names what does the looking.

/** One pick from `pool` that is none of `recent` (her last few beats, OLDEST first), at random
