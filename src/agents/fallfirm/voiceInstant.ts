// The waiting voice — Irises's "still on it" / "on it" reassurance while a
// delegated Ops look is still running. Built EXACTLY like the Composer relay (composeFollowUp) and
// the outcome voicer (voiceOutcome): a static persona (fallfirm/Progress.md) + a <prompt> dynamic
// block + a JSON bubble anchor + a voice-only window of the recent thread. The one thing it re-voices
// is different: not an Ops RESULT, but the wait itself — the hardcoded progress/holding beats that
// used to be one-shot canned lines. Injecting the thread is what lets it BLEND with the surrounding
// conversation and, above all, NEVER repeat a reassurance that's already on the user's screen.
//
// If this LLM call fails or comes back empty, we drop to floor.ts — the same zero-latency pooled
// phrases as before, now truly last-resort. Never throws.
