 * the engine holds none of her memory, and a heading ("Family") is not an answer to "which dana is
 * this?".
 *
 * The block travels as its OWN task field (`OpsTask.heldMemory`, rendered beside the brief by
 * ops/client.ts) and is deliberately NOT folded into `metaPrompt`. Two reasons, both about what the
 * brief IS: it is labelled the engine's "primary instruction", and it is the text scanned for
 * JavaScript/login-walled links (ops/walledUrls.ts) — so a reddit link inside a note that merely
 * shares a token with the ask would have armed browser tooling, widened the leg deadline the user
 * is promised, and given a thin second leg a URL to navigate to that nobody asked about.
 *
 * `{ block: '', count: 0 }` when she holds nothing about it, which is what keeps the task
 * byte-identical on every turn this changes nothing about. Whole lines are dropped at the total cap
 * rather than cut, so the last thing the engine reads is a whole held thing. Pure.
