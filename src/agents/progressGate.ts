// The throttle behind every "still waiting on Ops" reassurance (the mid-run heartbeat and Ops's tool
// milestones). Pulled out of the orchestrator so the timing law is one small, unit-tested unit.
//
// The law (user directive): at most 3 messages per task (holding line + at most 1 mid-run update +
// final answer). The mid-run update fires only after 5 minutes of silence, with at least 5 minutes
// between pings, and the hard cap of 1 per run. Both windows are env-overridable; the defaults
// encode the 5-minute / max-1 rule.
//
// `allow(key)` is the gate: it is SYNCHRONOUS and RESERVES the slot the moment it returns true, so a
// caller can check-then-voice (a slow LLM voice call) without a second concurrent milestone slipping
// through in the gap. `key` dedupes a repeat of the SAME milestone within one run (the tool name, or
// 'heartbeat') even when the voiced phrasing varies. `stop()` freezes the gate the instant Ops settles.

 * One ping's full life, with the ordering that makes the throttle correct:

 *      call, and two milestones landing together can't both slip through the async `voice` window.
 *   2. voice() — the slow part (reads the thread + a model call).
 *   3. gate.isStopped re-check — if Ops settled while we were voicing, drop this now-stale reassurance
 *      so it never lands AFTER the real answer.
 *   4. send(text).
 * Extracted from the orchestrator so this exact ordering is unit-testable (a future edit that voices
 * before gating, or forgets the post-voice re-check, fails a test instead of shipping a stale ping).
 * NEITHER `voice` NOR `send` may take the run down with it. Callers float this promise (`void
 * voiceAndPing(...)`, one of them from inside a setTimeout with no caller at all), and an unhandled
 * rejection is FATAL in this process — diagnostics/errorLog.ts turns it into process.exit(1). A
 * reassurance that failed to voice or failed to hand off is worth exactly nothing; it must never be
 * worth the whole delegation, so both halves are swallowed here.
