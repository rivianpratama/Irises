// The gate ↔ mouth interlock — the exact wiring runOpsAndFollowUp uses for progress pings, proven
// as a unit so a future edit can't reintroduce either race:
//   1. a ping that queues behind a held mouth (a live reply / the answer's own delivery) is DROPPED
//      once the run settles (gate.stop) — never a "still on it" landing after or between the
//      bubbles of the real answer;
//   2. a ping voiced before Irises said something else is DROPPED as stale (staleIfSpokenSince) —
//      it was voiced blind to that message;
//   3. an undisturbed ping still goes out (the throttle isn't a mute button).
// Pings ride the LOCK now (no more priority:'critical' bypass), so they can never split another
// message's bubbles — that ordering is asserted here too.
