// Charter (docs/PROMPTING_CHARTER.md): Law 12 / §10.1 "back unrecoverable rules with code" —
// a tool-name leak is classified unrecoverable (a brand reaches the user once and trust is
// dented), so it gets a deterministic backstop. §3 Invariant Core ("never name internal
// machinery"); §9.4 the deliberately triple-guarded hand-back.
//
// This is a TRIPWIRE, not the primary defense. The persona prompts are the primary defense;
// every warning logged below means one of them slipped and needs reinforcing (§10.1, §13).
//
// Policy: the user must never see the name of an internal agent/role, of the deep-work engine, or
// of the underlying model. Irises presents as ONE entity; the back-line roles ("Ops", "Reflexion"),
// the engines ("Hermes", "OpenClaw", "Claude Code"), the working vocabulary those engines narrate
// themselves in ("MCP tools", "subagents") and the model/provider names are all internal machinery.
// Irises's data sources — the web and the user's own email — are ordinary and fine to name, so there
// is no external data-vendor brand to scrub here. The agents may name their internal roles freely to
// EACH OTHER; this only rewrites text on its way to the user, so a model slip — or the
// composer-failure path that relays Ops's raw summary with no model in the loop — can never crack
// the single-entity seam.
//
// Deliberately NOT scrubbed: "gateway". It is too ordinary a word (a gateway community, the gateway
// listing) and a real leak always co-occurs with "openclaw", which IS scrubbed — so gating it would
// buy nothing and cost false positives.
