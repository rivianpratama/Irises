// The turn-focus block: the last thing inside <prompt>, and the only place in a ~45k-char system
// prompt that says "answer what they just said". Two halves are tested here:
//
//   • the pure renderer + the shape classifier (no clock, no DB, no LLM) — a table of real messages
//     against their classified shape, the two length caps, the hit cap, and the no-hits line;
//   • the PLACEMENT, through the real assembler on four different turn shapes (plain, burst, tapped
//     reply, caller addendum): the block must be the last dyn section by `sections` order AND the
//     last thing before `</prompt>` by string position. Charter §11.3 is that placement rule, and
//     "last" is the whole mechanism — a restatement the model reads before anything of hers.
//
// Sibling of promptSections.test.ts and built the same way: buildSystemPromptSections is called
// directly, nothing here reaches a lane, a DB, or the selection engine.
