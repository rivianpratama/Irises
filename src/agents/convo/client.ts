 *
 * It only ever gets stricter. The first thing that fails disarms it for the rest of the turn and

 * to judge, exactly as if nothing had streamed:
 *   • a `tool_calls` verdict that is anything but a confirmed empty one (the reader fails closed and
 *     reports it before the first sentence can exist), because a turn that acts can have its reply
 *     cut to a holding line or replaced by the results;
 *   • a sentence the per-sentence scan blocks (a promise, a claim, a refusal, an internal leak), or one
 *     that cleans down to nothing;
 *   • a sentence from a bubble at or past the count guard's last kept slot (bubbleJson.ts
 *     collectBubbles keeps the first BUBBLE_HARD_CAP-1 bubbles and the LAST one, so a bubble in
 *     between may not survive the parse, and one that went out early could not be taken back);
 *   • a send that fails, so an opening can never arrive with a hole in it.
 *
 * Sends run strictly in order on one chain, never overlapping: the send path paces each bubble, and
 * a second sentence must not overtake the first. `settled()` is that chain, and the turn waits on it
 * before it settles the reply, so `sent` is final by then: exactly what reached their screen, down to
 * the pieces of a sentence whose send failed partway (the sink reports what it got out).
 *
 * `committed()` is whether any sentence was handed to the sink at all, which is final the moment the
 * lane returns (it drops deltas after that). It is the question the recovery paths ask: a streamed
 * reply with nothing committed is a reply nobody has seen, so the ordinary retries may still run on
 * it; one with something committed may not answer over the top of it. `freeze()` disarms for good,
 * for a caller about to make a call of its own that must not stream.

  // the thread pre-read, because its answer gates that one: a task turn makes no thread offer.
  //
  // Three steps, all of them decided before a single prompt byte is assembled:
  //   1. the turn gate (persona/idle.ts) — the structural reads, then the English fast path, then at
  //      most one tiny classify call for a message the fast path could not read or was barred from;
  //   2. the compiled affect directive (persona/affectCompiler.ts) — the same gauges the weather
  //      block renders, read for what they CLOSE rather than for what they say;
  //   3. the selector (persona/hooks.ts) — the ledger, the kill switch, the group rules.
  //
  // The whole block is gated by CONVO_HOOKS_ENABLED, read once at the top of the turn (`hooksOn`,
  // up beside the prefetch that is the flag's other consumer). Off means no turn gate runs at all —
  // so no classify call is ever made, by the gate or by the prefetch — the directive is null, the
  // `Turn:` line and the `hooks` section are never rendered, the hook and share craft pages never
  // load, and the thread engine offers exactly as it did before any of this existed.

  // The ledger row for this chat, and the epoch it was read under: the write at the end of the turn
  // is fenced on the epoch, so a /forget landing mid-turn cannot have its wipe undone by a save that
  // read the pre-forget state. Defaults (and epoch 0) with the flag off — nothing is read and
  // nothing will be written.
  //
  // Read BEFORE the gate rather than after it, which is the 2026-09-11 move: the gate now needs the
