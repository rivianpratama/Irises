// The Convo system prompt, named by section.
//
// buildSystemPromptSections (agents/convo/shared.ts) assembles the front-line prompt out of a fixed
// vocabulary of parts; this module owns their NAMES, the type derived from those names, and the
// arithmetic that turns a measured section list back into the assembled length. Nothing here renders
// anything or knows what a section says — it is deliberately tiny and near dependency-free (one
// import, for the wrapper tag) so the per-turn trace and the prompt-budget test can measure the
// prompt without importing the 1.7k-line assembler.

/**
 * The sections assembled INSIDE a `<prompt>…</prompt>` block, in the exact order the assembler emits
 * them. The prompt is TWO messages now (see SYSTEM_SECTION_NAMES below), and this list is both of
 * their blocks back to back: the four sections that are stable for the whole chat first — they ride
 * the system message — then every per-turn section, which rides the tail message placed after the
 * chat history. The order is load-bearing three times over: charter §11.3's placement rule (static
 * first, volatile per-turn data last) IS this order, the prefix cache only reaches history when the
 * system half holds nothing that moves between turns, and the size arithmetic below counts the
 * `\n\n` joins between whichever sections of each half actually rendered. Every entry is
 * conditional except `model_map`, `update_status` and `current_time`, so a real build carries a
 * subsequence of this list, never all of it.
 *
 * A new section is per-turn unless it is added to SYSTEM_SECTION_NAMES, and it takes its place in
 * the per-turn run wherever its push site sits.
 *
 * `turn_focus` is last on purpose and must STAY last: it restates the message the whole prompt is
 * there to answer, and the recency edge is what makes it a counterweight rather than one more voice
 * in the pile (convo/turnFocus.ts). A new section belongs before it, never after.

 *     it — wrapPrompt('') is `<prompt>\n\n</prompt>`, and the arithmetic gets that right because the
 *     wrapper's own two newlines are its opening and closing ones);
 *   • its frame joins: one `\n\n` after the persona in the system, two in the tail (after the block,
 *     and between the two anchors).
 *
 * Exact so long as every dyn section's text is already trimmed: wrapPrompt trims the JOINED body, so
 * a leading blank line on the first rendered section (or a trailing one on the last) would be
 * dropped from the message yet still counted here. Every renderer returns trimmed text today —
 * renderActiveOps, the one that doesn't, is `.trim()`ed at its push site — and
