// Coverage for the MEMORY-AWARE routing gate — the never-event from the 2026-09-03 correspondence
// run. Asked "how many days till dana's wedding again", Convo replied "39 days / oct 12, you're
// doing the toast", read straight off a held note. The gate saw only the text ("how many" → a data
// question), discarded that correct answer, force-delegated, and the engine — which holds none of
// her memory — came back with "which dana is this?".
//
// So two things are pinned here, on one live path each:
//   • the gate STANDS DOWN when something she holds touches the ask and she wrote an answer off it;
//   • and when a delegation does happen, the brief carries her own words for those things, so the
//     engine can never have to ask which Dana.
//
// The relevance router is the real one (memory/relevance.ts) built off real held items, so the hit
// kinds and labels under test are the ones a live turn produces. Runs end-to-end against the
// ephemeral DB backend; voiceInstant degrades to its static floor when the LLM call fails, so
// processConvoResult runs for real, exactly as refusalFloor.test.ts does.
