// Layer 3 of the turn gate, wired: the one tiny call that reads a veto-free message the English fast
// path could not read or was barred from (persona/idle.ts).
//
// Since 2026-09-11 that is two kinds of message rather than one. The old one is the short stall in a
// script the examples cannot read. The new one is every message under the share cap that a
// not-a-stall signal already disqualified from the fast path — a sentence about their day, which is
// the shape a bid arrives in — and it is the reason this lane now answers with four words.
//
// The gate itself is a leaf and stays one — it never picks a lane, never sets a deadline and never
// caches. This module is the production wiring it takes as an argument: the classify lane, five
// tokens of budget, a six-second deadline, an in-process cache, and one receipt per reading. A test
// drives the same three layers by injecting its own function and never touches a network.
//
// FAILING TOWARD TASK, everywhere. A thrown lane, a spent budget, an install with no classify lane,
// a deadline that fired, an answer that is not one of the four words — every one of them comes back
// `unclear`, which persona/idle.ts reads as a task turn. The asymmetry is the whole design: the cost
// of a wrong task turn is one flat reply, and the cost of a wrong idle turn is a clever line landing
// on a piece of work.
//
// WHY A CACHE. Idle messages are the most repetitive text a person sends — "hmm", "ya", "sama",
// "bosan" — and each of them is one message the fast path cannot read and the lane can. Caching the
// VERDICT per normalised text means a person's own handful of stalls costs a handful of calls in the
// life of the process, not one per turn. It is keyed on the text alone, deliberately: the question
// this lane answers ("does this message ask for anything") is a property of the words and of nothing
// else — not the chat, not the hour, not who typed it — so a per-chat cache would be the same
// answer stored many times over. Process-local and unpersisted: a restart costs a few calls.
//
// A share is the opposite kind of text — a sentence about a day is said once and never again — so
// those entries are the ones the cap below evicts, and they are why the cap is a count of readings
// and not a count of stalls. The cache earns its keep on the repetitive half and simply carries the
// other half until it falls off the end.
//
// WHY A WARM, AND WHY IT COALESCES. Since 2026-09-24 the call is started at the inbound door, while
// the burst settles (`warmIdleClassify`, called from index.ts), instead of on the reply path. The
// settle wait is the same order of time as five tokens on a working lane, so by the time the gate
// asks, the verdict is a cache hit or a call already in flight that the gate simply waits on. The
// in-flight map is what makes that safe: one text is one lane call and one receipt whichever of the
// two gets there first, and the warm itself files nothing because nobody has read it yet.
