// The unkept-promise guard — the honesty backstop under the ONE failure the persona names as
// unrecoverable: a reply that promises work while nothing is actually being done for the user.
//
// Observed live (VPS, 2026-09-02). The user asked for a browser look. The reply: "yeah, i already
// told hermes to use the browser … still on it, hang tight" — with `tool_calls: null`
// and no run in flight, the earlier one having finished 2.5h before. A fabricated in-flight claim,
// and nothing in the pipeline was looking for it: the routing gate reads the USER's message (and read
// that one as social), and the false-refusal floor reads the draft for the opposite failure — a claim
// that something is impossible. A promise is a claim about the FUTURE, so it can only be checked
// against what the turn actually DID, which is what this module is for.
//
// PURE: the lexicon and the verdict. The one corrective re-ask lives in the call path
// (convo/shared.ts, beside the JSON-envelope retry it mirrors) — only that has a model to re-ask.
// The same guard reads the mirror-image claim (a change said to have landed with nothing behind it,
// the unbacked-claim half below), and both share that one re-ask.

/**
 * The promise lexicon — ENGLISH-ONLY: her L1 is English, and a hand-written list for any other
 * language is the thing the language-agnostic rule forbids (user, 2026-09-04) — a promise in another
 * language is the model's own `[[re:N]]` tag / the classify lane's business, never this array's.
 * Whole phrases, not words: single words ("checking") carry no commitment on their own, and the
 * verdict here costs a model call.
 *
 * SINGLE SOURCE (the THEME_KINDS pattern): the trigger and the re-ask's accept check read this same
 * array, so a phrase can never be one the guard fires on but the retry is not held to. Deliberately
 * short — every entry is a phrase whose plain reading is "work is happening right now", which is
 * exactly the claim a turn with no tool call and no active run cannot back.
 *
 * The `let me check` / `lemme check`, `digging through`, `looking up that` and `reading that page`
 * rows were added when the delegate doc and the JSON anchor still taught example holding lines, and
 * they stay because she still writes those shapes.
 *
 * `looking up that` and `reading that page` have a gerund-subject reading that promises nothing —
 * "looking up that address is free on the county site", "reading that page yourself is faster" — so
 * each can cost a corrective re-ask on an honest reply. Accepted, and not a new risk: `looking that
 * up` has fired on "looking that up yourself is free on the county site" since the row was first
 * written (verified), so the array already took that trade. Severity tips it: a missing row ships a
 * fabricated in-flight claim, the one failure the persona calls unrecoverable, while a false row
 * costs one model call on a sentence she rarely writes.
 *
 * The short waits. The delegate doc now asks for a varied beat, and a thinking sound or a short wait
 * is one of its shapes. The waits whose only reading is "wait for me while I do something" are rows:
 * `one sec` and `give me a sec`, beside `gimme a sec` and `give me a minute`. The bare thinking
 * sounds, and the waits that also read as surprise (`hold on`, `wait a sec`), are deliberately left
 * out: she uses those as reactions in banter, so a row of them would re-ask honest replies all day,
 * and a corrective re-ask on an honest reply is the worse failure once it stops being rare. A
 * thinking sound alone promises no specific work, so an undelegated one reads as a reaction and
 * breaks no promise.
 *
 * Bare `checking` and bare `looking` stay out for the matcher's sake: it matches a phrase anywhere
 * inside a clause, so a row of `checking` would fire on "worth checking with a doctor before you rely
 * on this" and "checking that yourself is the faster route", neither of which promises anything. A
 * one-word entry cannot be restricted to a whole-clause reading without changing the matcher.
 * Multi-word rows only.
