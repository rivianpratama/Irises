// The craft modules: nine pages of Convo's persona that only some turns need.
//
// Until P4a/P4b every one of them was a section of Context.md, which means every one of them was in
// front of the model on every turn — the send-order read on a turn with no history, the burst
// tradecraft on a single message, nine thousand characters of onboarding craft nine months into a
// relationship, nine thousand more on how to tag a thread on a turn with no thread on offer. They
// are now files under convo/craft/, each behind a STRUCTURAL gate (a fact about this turn, never a
// judgement about it), and this file holds two very different claims about them.
//
// The first is the CORPUS PIN: the shared persona block, the persona and every craft page, joined in
// canonical order, has a length and a sha256 written down below. It replaces the pre-P4a relocation golden, which
// reconstructed the pre-split Context.md out of these files and hashed it. That golden was not
// broken by the commit that swapped it out — it is retired on the plan's instruction, because the
// persona rewrite this branch is building rewrites the relocated prose itself, and a document none
// of these pages is a copy of any more cannot be reconstructed out of them. What the pin buys is
// narrower and still worth having: prose has no other test, and an accidental edit moves these two
// numbers and nothing else in the suite.
//
// The second is the gates: which modules a turn loads, and that the ones it doesn't are reported
// with the fact they read. Those are unit assertions over `renderCraftModules`, plus the placement
// check through the real assembler at the bottom.
process.env.TZ = 'UTC';
// The last test runs a whole turn through the front door, which reads and writes the stores.

/**
 * `convoPersonaWithCraft()` — the shared persona block, Context.md, then every craft page in
 * registry order — as it stands right now: its length, and the sha256 of exactly those bytes.
 *
 * This REPLACES the pre-P4a relocation golden, and the swap is scheduled, not forced. That golden
 * reconstructed the pre-split Context.md out of these files and pinned its sha256; the reconstruction
 * walks its own RELOCATION table, so a page that table does not name is never spliced, and the ninth
 * craft page left the golden passing byte for byte. What ends it is the prose commit later on this
 * branch: it rewrites the relocated sections themselves, and once the pages stop being copies of what
 * was moved out there is no pre-split document left to reconstruct. The plan's test-wall row retires
 * the golden there; it is retired HERE, one wave early, on this task's instruction, with the pin
 * below covering the same prose from this commit onward. The relocation was checked, commit by
 * commit, for as long as there was one to check.
 *
 * What this pin is worth is narrower and quite specific: the persona corpus is prose, prose has no
 * other test, and an accidental edit — a stray page, a registry row that drops one, a rewrite dressed
 * as a tidy-up — moves these two numbers and nothing else in the suite. The prose commit re-measures
 * them, says what changed, and writes the new pair in here.
 *
 * Re-measured twice since. First: +7,174 characters when the shared persona block took its place at
 * the head of the corpus (persona/policy.ts renderPersonaBlock — 7,885 bytes, plus the `\n\n` join).
 * Not a page and not an edit to one: the block is the personality all four prompt surfaces now render
 * byte-identically, and this is the surface where it lands inside the cached persona head. Every
 * other byte of the corpus was untouched, which is why exactly one addend moved.
 *
 * Then **−24,598** in the prose commit, which is the largest single move this pin will ever record
 * and the other half of the block's arrival: the character the block now states was still standing in
 * Context.md as its own prose, in four voices, and it comes out here. Four addends moved and every
 * other byte held.
 *   · Context.md −23,926 (100,746 → 76,820). It is the FRONT-LINE FUNCTION file now: "Who Irises is",
 *     "Adaptive style" and "How you address them" are deleted outright (the block carries all three),
 *     the Lowndes playbook is replaced by ELEVEN first-principle moves, "run the stack" is rebuilt on
 *     the task/idle split, "How you write" keeps only the floor state, and the inner-weather section
 *     is re-authored around a block that instructs instead of describing. The opening ABSOLUTE RULE
 *     blockquote came out here too, which was a mistake — see the +438 below, where it goes back.
 *   · craft/onboarding.md −3,151 and craft/threading.md −1,373: both rewritten in the new register
 *     rather than trimmed, and both lighter for it — the threading page's ladder, materials and modes
 *     are intact, and the first-contact page trades charm framing for one flat read.
 *   · craft/hooks.md +3,852 (709 → 4,561): the ninth page stops being T3's placeholder and becomes
 *     the real one — the three kinds, what each is built from, the predict-then-collect move, the
 *     quiet reply, and the clause `RULE_ANCHORS.response_overrules` now anchors on, which moved here
 *     from Context.md because this is where the beat it governs is taught.
 *
 * Then **+438** in the supervisor-corrections commit, all of it Context.md (76,820 → 77,258) and all
 * three moves prose fixes rather than design:
 *   · +489 — the opening ABSOLUTE RULE blockquote is BACK as line 3, byte-identical to `main`. Its
 *     deletion was an accident of a mislabelled spec range ("title + three intro paragraphs" also
 *     swallowed the blockquote), never an editorial call, and the four-field envelope rule belongs at
 *     the primacy edge as well as the recency one — the two-copy drift strategy CLAUSE_INVENTORY's
 *     header in promptPolicy.ts describes.
 *   · −53 — the confidence section's tone paragraph stated its own law twice ("Their emotion tunes
 *     your TONE, never your score" and then "your register, never your score" one clause later); the
 *     second statement goes, the paragraph keeps its lead-in and its close.
 *   · +2 — §Language's lead-in said "Two rules on top of it" over three bullets. A miscount that
 *     predates this branch and sat inside a KEEP range.
 *
 * Then **−363** in the second supervisor-corrections commit, which carries one rule the whole-branch
 * review settled — a task turn answers and stops — plus the register remnants found beside it. Three
 * files moved and every other byte held:
 *   · Context.md −326 (77,258 → 76,932): the trailing offer goes in four places (the bubble-count
 *     paragraph, the tip demo's RIGHT half, the breakdown bullet and first principle 3), and the
 *     machinery law loses its first sentence, which the shared persona block already states. The tip's
 *     RIGHT example is ONE bubble now rather than two, which is the rule shown as well as said.
 *   · craft/reminders.md −39 (2,674 → 2,635): the confirmation she writes after setting one is a
 *     flat confirming text, and an antisocial hour is stated plainly, once, and set anyway.
 *   · craft/send-order.md +2 (3,776 → 3,778): the one page on this branch that GREW, and it grew
 *     for a reason worth the line — the thumbs-up emoji spelled out as "a thumbs-up tapback" is +17,
 *     against −14 for a close that is flat rather than warm and −1 for the RIGHT label above it.
 *
 * Then **−140** in the third supervisor-corrections commit, which is the same rule reaching the last
 * two convo files that still taught the beat it retires. Two files moved and every other byte held:
 *   · Context.md −67 (76,932 → 76,865): the three-bubble demo's RIGHT label reads "then stop" and its
 *     third bubble is the third fact rather than a trailer, and self-check 6 stops telling her to
 *     leave the overflow in reach when the count runs over — it says cut to three and stop.
 *   · craft/send-order.md −73 (3,778 → 3,705): the passing-mention bullet becomes the rule it was
 *     always written for — only an explicit ask is work — which settles their "ok" without first
 *     teaching the beat in order to exempt it. The page that GREW last commit gives it back.
 *
 * The largest prose move in that commit is NOT in this number: composer/Context.md came down 376
 * characters in the same pass (seven pairs, the same rule), and the Composer's file is not part of
 * this corpus. Nothing pins its bytes — the sha256 here covers convo's persona and craft only.
 *
 * Then **−55** in the fourth supervisor-corrections commit, ONE file and two clauses, and the beat it
 * retires is out of the convo corpus entirely after it:
 *   · craft/send-order.md −55 (3,705 → 3,650), itemised: −39 where the reply-order paragraph stopped
 *     illustrating a run of bubbles as an answer followed by a little passing-mention trailer — it
 *     reads "picking up the first of them, not the last", which is the ORDER claim the paragraph is
 *     about and needs no example beat to make it; and −16 where the short-ack bullet stopped naming
 *     that trailer as the thing an "ok" is not consent to run, and names "anything else you
 *     named" instead, because the bullet has to hold after the beat is gone and a rule that turns on
 *     a beat she no longer sends holds nothing.
 * Context.md did not move: the third commit above took its last two copies. The other half of this
 * commit is not in this number either and never could be — shared.ts's `json_anchor` capped her at
 * three items and then said where to leave the overflow, and it now says "the top of it now and
 * stop" (−18); the anchor is generated prose at the recency edge rather than a page of the corpus
 * (promptSections.test.ts pins its bytes, promptPolicy.ts its size).
 *
 * Then **+326** in the late-night-register commit, the first of these that BUYS prose rather than
 * deleting it — because the thing being deleted is a SCRIPT, and a script is replaced by a register
 * rather than by silence. Three files moved:
 *   · craft/hooks.md +242: the quiet-reply paragraph splits in two. "The quiet reply." keeps the
 *     fixed shape and stops mentioning the hour at all; "Late is not quiet." is new, and it is where
 *     the whole intervention lives — a late turn is an idle turn with whatever kinds it left open, at
 *     a lower volume, their goodnight never comes back as hers, and never the same shape two nights
 *     running. Longer than the clause it replaces, and it has to be: one sentence telling her what to
 *     send is short, and telling her that the hour changes only the volume takes a paragraph.
 *   · PERSONA_BLOCK +71 (policy.ts, rendered ahead of Context.md in this corpus): the late-night
 *     sentence says the hour makes her smaller and quieter and changes nothing else, and the
 *     addressing sentence drops "else their name" — their name is a thing she knows, not a word she
 *     drops into a bubble.
 *   · Context.md +13: −42 in the per-turn-block paragraph (the clock's line described as a size
 *     rather than a script) and +55 in the time-of-day bullet, which now says the hour changes the
 *     volume and the ordinary idle-turn rules pick the content.
 *
 * Then **+642** in the own-wording commit, ONE file:
 *   · PERSONA_BLOCK +642 (policy.ts): a new paragraph inside "How you write". Her own wording is
 *     spent the moment she sends it — an opener, a closer, a turn of phrase does not come back in a
 *     later bubble whether or not the point is new; a line that arrives ready-made counts as already
 *     sent even when the thread no longer shows it; their words may be echoed, hers may not; facts
 *     keep their exact values. It is the general rule the corpus until now stated only at its sites
 *     (the settled-ground re-ask, holding lines, hook callbacks, teases), and it lives in the block
 *     because the block is the one string every lane renders. Context.md and every page: untouched.
