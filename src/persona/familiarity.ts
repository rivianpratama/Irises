// HOW WELL SHE KNOWS THEM, as one number that never prints.
//
// The mood engine runs the same way with everyone: a hidden weather, compiled into instructions on
// every turn (affectCompiler.ts). What changes from person to person is how much of it they get to
// see. A stranger gets her composed, and someone she has known for a month gets the whole weather.
// This file is the arithmetic that says where a person sits between those two, and all it hands the
// rest of the stack is a band name.
//
// FOUR FINDINGS, FOUR RULES (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-26-familiarity-mask-design.md):
//   • intimacy grows in layers, positive before negative, and too much too soon reads wrong (Altman
//     and Taylor), so the level is PACED by the days they have actually talked;
//   • with people we barely know we hold the content of a feeling while its energy leaks (Gross), so
//     the band decides content and never shape (affectCompiler.ts MASK_OPENS);
//   • a room is front stage (Goffman), so a group reads as a stranger, always;
//   • the mask drops on responsiveness and not on knowledge alone (Reis and Shaver), so rapport
//     landing badly pulls it back up a band (affectCompiler.ts compileMask).
//
// THE NUMBER IS ARITHMETIC OVER STORES, never a model's report (charter §10.1, the bargain rapport
// and the climate dials make): turns and active days off the ledger row, and what she holds about
// them read off the memory stores at compute time, each source worth a fixed number of points up to
// its own cap. The caps sum to a hundred. Nothing here reads a clock: a quiet stretch is not evidence,
// so the level never decays on silence (climate's rule) and falls only when what she holds shrinks.
//
// PURE and a LEAF: no DB, no clock read, no env, and it imports nothing, so the compiler, the
// repository, the musings sweep and the dashboard can all import it for the price of a string.
