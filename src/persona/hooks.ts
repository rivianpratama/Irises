// The HOOK engine: what a turn is allowed to carry, which kinds are still open to it, and the
// ledger that makes three sharp replies in a row cost the fourth one.
//
// A hook is the ONE extra beat an idle turn may carry — a judgment, a callback, or a tangent. It
// exists because the alternative is the failure this whole build is named after: "hey" answered
// with "hey", a contentless reply that spends a turn and hands back nothing. Task turns get NO hook
// (the answer, flat, with the real numbers, is the entire reply), and quiet turns get less than
// that. So the modes are not volumes of the same voice — they are different contracts, and exactly
// one of them is live per turn.
//
// A SHARE turn is the fourth contract and the one that inverts the arithmetic above. They handed her
// something and asked for nothing, which is a bid, and the move is not an extra beat after an answer
// — it IS the reply, because there is nothing else for the reply to be. So the share branch has no
// kill switch (a run of moves on share turns is a conversation, not a tic), never goes quiet (a bid
// answered with silence is the receipt this shape exists to refuse), and is the one place the fourth
// kind — the question — can be open at all. Everything else it reads, it reads the same way a hook
// turn does: the repeated tail kind, the mood's own bans, the room.
//
// Doctrine, inherited whole from threads.ts next door: the model contributes ONE word inside the
// envelope it already emits (`hook_kind`), and every count, transition and budget below is
// arithmetic over one stored row. Nothing here costs an LLM call. Nothing here reads a clock — the
// engine is PURE the way `applyThreadHarvest` is: `now` injected, inputs never mutated, and every
// turn the selector ran landing in exactly one disjoint `reason` bucket, so a receipt can never say
// two things at once about why she went quiet.
//
// This file is a LEAF: it imports nothing, from anywhere. status.ts (the envelope field), the db
// (the ledger row) and the convo lane (the caller) all sit DOWNSTREAM of it, and the convergence
// battery re-exports the constants below as VALUES rather than re-typing the numbers — a threshold
// pinned to a copied number is a threshold that silently stops describing the engine.
//
// The kill switch is the load-bearing piece. Three hooked replies in a row and the fourth IDLE turn
// goes quiet whatever else is true: it outranks the affect floor, the group rules, the moment
// sampler and the thread offer. Someone who has sent nothing four times running is not asking for a
// fourth clever line, and a bot that keeps producing them is the exact thing the manifesto refuses.
// What it is a switch on is SILENCE answered with cleverness, which is why a share turn is outside
// it: the person on the other end just said something.
