// The turn gate: does this turn ask for anything, hand her something, or stall?
//
// THREE KINDS OF TURN, and the whole hook engine hangs off which one this is (persona/hooks.ts). A
// TASK turn gets the answer, flat, with the real numbers and nothing else. An IDLE turn — they sent
// nothing to act on and told nothing either — is the one turn a reply may carry a hook. A SHARE turn
// is the one in between: they handed her something about their own day and asked for nothing, which
// is a bid, and the reply is one move about the thing they handed her. So a gate that reads "deploy
// prod" as idle spends a work turn on a clever line, a gate that reads "hmm" as work produces the
// leaf this whole build is named after, and a gate that reads "morning meeting moved" as either one
// answers a bid with a receipt.
//
// LANGUAGE-AGNOSTIC, THREE LAYERS, FAILING TOWARD TASK. This is the 2026-09-04 rule (see the header
// of agents/ops/consent.ts, which reads a reply the same way): no hand-written word list is ever the
// last word on what a person's message means, because a person may text in any language and a list
// only ever knows one.
//
//   1. STRUCTURAL READS — script-independent facts about the message and the turn around it, split
//      in two by what they can prove. A WORK VETO proves the turn is work: a question mark, a link,
//      a message past the share cap, a file that arrived, a look already running, an answer owed.
//      Any one of them and the turn is a task, with no call at all. A NOT-A-STALL SIGNAL proves
//      something weaker and useful — a digit, a sentence's worth of tokens or characters, a burst —
//      namely that whatever this message is, it is not one of the stalls the English list knows. It
//      bars the fast path and goes on to layer 3, because "too long to be a stall" is the commonest
//      shape a share arrives in. Neither layer reads a word.
//   2. THE ENGLISH FAST PATH — LEAF_EXAMPLES below. EXAMPLES, NOT A LAW: a short message every one
//      of whose tokens is a known English stall is idle, for free, with no call. The list is small
//      on purpose and extensible without a code change (LEAF_EXAMPLES_EXTRA), because it is a
//      shortcut for the commonest case and never a definition of the case. It may only speak for a
//      message it can READ WHOLE — see `fastPathCanRead`, and the paragraph under it — and never for
//      one a signal already marked as no stall.
//   3. THE CLASSIFY FALLBACK — everything veto-free the fast path could not read or was barred from:
//      a Spanish "nada", an Indonesian "bosan", a Japanese stall with no Latin tokens at all, and
//      every message long enough to be a share. The caller injects it (convo/idleClassify.ts wires
//      it); this module only knows it returns one of four words. `stall` and `share` are the two
//      that are not work. Anything else — `ask`, `unclear`, a garbled answer, a thrown call, a lane
//      that timed out — is a task. That call sits on the reply path, so `classifyNeeded` below lets
//      the caller PREDICT it from the facts it holds early and start it in parallel with its own
//      memory read; the prediction is allowed to be wrong in one direction only, and says so.
//
// AND THE FAST PATH NEVER HALF-READS A MESSAGE. A person may text in any language, and a real
// message is often MIXED: one English ack and a clause in another script ("ok 볼래", "hmm 明日は").
// `words` below drops every non-Latin character, so a message like that tokenizes down to its one
// ASCII token — and a fast path that judged those tokens alone would read a request as a stall on
// the strength of the single word it happened to be able to see. The English list is English by
// design; the honest consequence is that layer 2 may decide ONLY a message with nothing in it the
// tokenizer would drop (`fastPathCanRead`). Everything else belongs to layer 3, which reads any
// script — one small call, never a wrong reading.
//
// THE THIRD SHAPE IS FLAGGED (`IdleOptions.shareTurns`, CONVO_SHARE_TURNS_ENABLED at the caller).
// Off, every signal is a veto again and a `share` verdict is read as a task, which is this gate's
// answer to every message in the pre-share table, layer for layer. The flag's whole contract is that
// an install with it off cannot tell this file changed.
//
// This file is a LEAF: it imports nothing, from anywhere. `words` below is MIRRORED from
// convo/turnFocus.ts rather than imported for exactly that reason (that module imports the prompt
// tagger), and the consent reading arrives as a plain union rather than as ops/consent.ts's `Consent`
// (that module imports the LLM client). Both duplications are two lines and are named here so the
// day one of them drifts is a day somebody reads this paragraph.
//
// PURE: no clock, no DB, no LLM of its own. The one env read is LEAF_EXAMPLES_EXTRA, parsed at CALL
// time so a live install can widen the fast path without a restart.
