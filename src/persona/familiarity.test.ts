// How well she knows someone, as arithmetic. Everything here is pure, and every rule the spec states
// is pinned from both sides:
//
//   • THE TABLE IS THE SPEC. Ten sources, each with a point value and a cap, and the caps sum to a
//     hundred, so a person she holds everything about, over enough days, is a hundred.
//   • WHO SAYS SO DISCOUNTS. A fact they stated is worth more than one she guessed, and a guess more
//     than one the engine handed over.
//   • THE PACE IS THE DAYS. However much she holds, the level cannot pass ten plus three per active
//     day, so a fact dump in one evening hits the ceiling.
//   • THE SLEW IS TWO. The stored level moves at most two points a turn either way.
//   • A FIRST ROW IS SEEDED FROM TENURE. The days since they were first seen, capped at thirty, and
//     the turns the thread harvest has counted, with today's tick on top.
//   • A ROOM IS A STRANGER, whatever is stored.
