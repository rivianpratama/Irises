//
// The persona policy. Two things live in this module and both of them are prose, so these tests are
// about the properties the prose has to KEEP rather than about its sentences:
//
//   • ONE PERSON ON EVERY SURFACE. `renderPersonaBlock` returns the same bytes for all four lanes.
//     That is the whole reason the block was lifted out of four Context.md files, and the day a lane
//     grows a sentence of its own is the day the four-lane drift starts again.
//   • THE ANCHOR IS SIX BULLETS, IN EVERY COMBINATION. Four modes times two window bands is eight
//     renderings, and promptPolicy.test.ts pins "six `- ` lines, zero digits" over whichever one the
//     turn produced — so it is pinned here over all eight, where a bad paste is one file from the
//     edit. The count is the anchor's own law and not an accident of how many modes there are: the
//     recency edge buys six lines, so a mode added to the turn vocabulary says its whole law inside
//     the three the mode half owns or it does not get to be a mode here.
//   • NO DIGITS ANYWHERE IN IT. Not cosmetic: a number at the recency edge is a number she can read
//     out, and every number in her replies has to be one she actually saw.
//   • THE WINDOW ONLY MOVES THE COMMON BULLETS. A long transcript buys identity restatement, never a
//     different law for the turn.
//   • AND THE BLOCK STILL DESCRIBES NO ENVELOPE FIELD. The status contract owns the field list; a
//     field described in two places drifts in one.
//
// PURE, so there is no fixture and no clock here — every case is a call and a string.
