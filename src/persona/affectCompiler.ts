// The AFFECT COMPILER: where the hidden machinery stops DESCRIBING a mood and starts issuing
// instructions. Everything this file owns used to be prose — a paragraph of body-clock texture, a
// paragraph of cycle texture, a five-band mood essay, a clause of gauge words, a trajectory line —
// handed to the model on every single turn with no rule in it, on the theory that a model reading
// "Fe senses a small distance it cannot place" would arrive at the right register by itself. What it
// actually bought was tone: eighteen hundred characters of adjectives about a person who then
// answered the question exactly the same way.
//
// So the machinery stays and the prose goes. The gauges, the Willcox core and the standing register
// COMPILE, here, into at most four imperative lines: how sharp (the core's own sentence), how short
// (the social battery), whether the beat is open at all (the mood floor, the core and the climate
// floors), and whether it is late where they are — which is a REGISTER and nothing else: the hour
// lowers the volume of a reply and never picks its content. Everything above is arithmetic the model
// never sees; everything below is a sentence it can obey.
//
// NOT EVERY COMPILED FIELD IS A SENTENCE, and since the share turn landed two of them are not.
// `question` (may this reply carry the one follow-up question) and `heavy` (they brought weight)
// are CEILINGS the rhythm engine reads; the renderer never writes either one down. What reaches the
// model is a presence and an absence: whether the share section carries its question line, and how
// short that section's list of open kinds is. A rendered line announcing that a question is
// available would be read as an instruction to ask one, which is the exact failure this shape
// corrects — the machinery sets the ceiling and she judges inside it.
//
// THE WHEEL IS THE VARIABLE. `mood_label` is the one thing the model still reports about how it
// feels, `coreForLabel` (mood.ts) is what files that word under one of six cores, and CORE_DIRECTIVES
// is what each core CHANGES about the reply. That is the whole loop: she says a true word, the chart
// places it, and the placement is an instruction rather than an adjective. A number that used to be
// printed beside the word ("hopeful (powerful, 72/100)") is gone for the reason the envelope's own
// numbers went (charter §6.4): a number printed beside a state is a number to optimize.
//
// PURE by construction, like every engine in this stack: no DB, no LLM, no clock read. The clock
// arrives as `ComputedState`, the register as `RelationshipClimate`, the carried row as the last
// `AffectStatus`, and the same three inputs always compile to the same directive.
//
// THE MASK is the last stage, and it decides what compiles, never what is true. How well she knows
// them arrives as a band (persona/familiarity.ts); `compileMask` pulls it up one notch when rapport
// has been landing badly, on the question gate's own line; MASK_OPENS says, band by band, which
// layers of the mood reach an instruction. Shape and energy always pass (the battery, the hook
// allowance the core carries, the question ceiling, the hour). Content opens in order, positive
// before negative, and the deepest layer, her mood putting an ask off, opens last. The gauges and
// the reported word run underneath at every band, and asked how she is she answers true at every
// band (FEELINGS_LINE_ASKED). No band at all is no mask: the compile as it stood before the stage.
//
// IMPORT DIRECTION, and it has to stay this way: status.ts imports this file BY VALUE, so everything
// this file takes from status.ts is `import type` and erased at compile time — the same edge, and the
// same argument, as affectDrift.ts's header states for itself. mood.ts, climate.ts and familiarity.ts
// are leaves, so those three are ordinary value imports and nothing can load back through them.
