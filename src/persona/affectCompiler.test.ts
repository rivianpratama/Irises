// Run with: npm test   (TZ=UTC tsx --test — runner pins DATA_BACKEND=memory)
// The affect compiler is where the machinery stops describing a mood and starts instructing from
// it. Everything it reads is arithmetic that already existed — the Willcox core behind the reported
// word, two gauges, two climate floor bands, the clock's slot — and everything it emits is a
// sentence a reply can obey. These tests pin all of it, plus the invariants the rest of the stack
// leans on:
//
//   • THE WHEEL IS THE VARIABLE. Each of the six cores maps to one imperative and one hook
//     permission, and the two halves of that row have to agree with each other.
//   • THE THRESHOLDS ARE NAMED, and pinned from BOTH sides of every boundary. A cut that slid by a
//     point is invisible otherwise, and these three decide how long a reply is and whether the extra
//     beat exists at all.
//   • PERMISSIONS COMBINE, never overwrite. The core, the candor floor and the playfulness floor
//     each close a kind; two different closures round DOWN to `none`, which is the safe direction.
//   • THE QUESTION IS A CEILING AND IT IS ONE-WAY. Four things can close her one follow-up question
//     — the wheel, the carried read of what they were doing, closeness, the two gauges that already
//     close the extra beat — and nothing opens one the core shut. Neither the ceiling nor the weight
//     flag reaches a rendered line: the model sees a section, never a sentence about a question.
//   • NOT ONE DIGIT reaches a rendered line. The gauges are the reason the lines say what they say
//     and they never appear in one — the same bargain the envelope's own shrink made (charter §6.4).
//   • PURE. No clock read, no store, no lane: the clock arrives as `ComputedState`, and a frozen
//     input survives a compile.
